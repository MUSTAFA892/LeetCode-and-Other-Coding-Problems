### **Function Purpose**:
The `topKFrequent` function finds the **`k` most frequent elements** from the list `nums`. If there are ties in frequency, the elements are sorted in descending order by frequency. The function returns these top `k` frequent elements as a list.

### **Code Explanation**:  
Here’s the code provided:

```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        ans  = []
        freq = Counter(nums)

        count = 0

        for val, cou in sorted(freq.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True):
            ans.append(val)
            count += 1
            if count == k:    
                break

        return ans
```

### **Step-by-Step Explanation**:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - `ans = []`: This initializes an empty list that will store the final result, which is the list of the `k` most frequent numbers.
   - `freq = Counter(nums)`: This uses the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each number in the `nums` list. The `Counter` will return a dictionary-like object where the keys are the numbers in the list, and the values are their frequencies.

2. **Loop through Sorted Frequency Items**:
   - `for val, cou in sorted(freq.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)`: This sorts the frequency dictionary `freq` by frequency (`x[1]` is the frequency) in **descending** order (`reverse=True`).
     - `sorted(freq.items())`: This returns a list of tuples where each tuple contains a number and its frequency.
     - `key=lambda x: x[1]`: Sorts by frequency, where `x[1]` is the frequency of each element.

3. **Populate the Result List**:
   - The loop starts iterating over each element and its frequency (`val` for the value, `cou` for the frequency).
   - `ans.append(val)`: Appends the current element (`val`) to the `ans` list.
   - `count += 1`: Increments the counter `count`, which tracks how many elements have been added to `ans`.
   - `if count == k: break`: If `count` equals `k` (i.e., we have added `k` elements to the result), the loop breaks.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, the list `ans`, which contains the `k` most frequent numbers, is returned.

### **Working Example**:

Let’s consider the example:

```python
nums = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]
k = 2
```

#### Step-by-Step Execution:

1. **Count Frequencies**:
   Using the `Counter`, the frequency of elements in the list `nums` is calculated:
   ```python
   freq = Counter(nums)  # freq = {1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 1}
   ```
   - `1` appears 3 times
   - `2` appears 2 times
   - `3` appears 1 time

2. **Sort by Frequency**:
   The frequency dictionary is sorted by frequency in descending order:
   ```python
   sorted(freq.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
   ```
   This results in:
   ```python
   [(1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1)]
   ```

3. **Populate the Result**:
   The function now iterates over the sorted list and adds the top `k` frequent elements:
   - For the first iteration (`val = 1`, `cou = 3`):
     - `ans = [1]`
     - `count = 1`
   - For the second iteration (`val = 2`, `cou = 2`):
     - `ans = [1, 2]`
     - `count = 2`

   Since `count` equals `k`, the loop breaks.

4. **Return the Result**:
   The function returns the list `ans`, which contains the top `k` frequent elements:
   ```python
   return [1, 2]
   ```

---

### **Final Output**:
```python
Output: [1, 2]
```

### **Why the Output is `[1, 2]`**:
- The frequency count of the elements in `nums` is:
  - `1` occurs 3 times
  - `2` occurs 2 times
  - `3` occurs 1 time
- We are asked for the top 2 frequent elements (`k=2`).
- After sorting by frequency in descending order, we get `[1, 2, 3]`. 
- The top 2 frequent elements are `[1, 2]`, which is the output.

---

### **Edge Case Considerations**:
- If `k` is equal to the number of unique elements in `nums`, the function will return all elements.
- If `k` is greater than the number of unique elements, an error might occur unless handled separately, but in this implementation, it assumes `k <= len(nums)`.

---

### **Another Example**:

Let’s consider another example:

```python
nums = [4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7]
k = 3
```

#### Execution:

1. **Count Frequencies**:
   ```python
   freq = Counter(nums)  # freq = {4: 3, 5: 2, 6: 3, 7: 1}
   ```

2. **Sort by Frequency**:
   Sorting by frequency:
   ```python
   sorted(freq.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
   ```
   Result:
   ```python
   [(4, 3), (6, 3), (5, 2), (7, 1)]
   ```

3. **Populate the Result**:
   - First iteration (`val = 4`, `cou = 3`):
     - `ans = [4]`
     - `count = 1`
   - Second iteration (`val = 6`, `cou = 3`):
     - `ans = [4, 6]`
     - `count = 2`
   - Third iteration (`val = 5`, `cou = 2`):
     - `ans = [4, 6, 5]`
     - `count = 3`

4. **Return the Result**:
   ```python
   return [4, 6, 5]
   ```

### **Final Output for this Example**:
```python
Output: [4, 6, 5]
```
