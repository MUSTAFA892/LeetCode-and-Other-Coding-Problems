### 1. **Function Definition and Input**:
   - The function `maxSubsequence` takes two inputs:
     - `nums`: A list of integers.
     - `k`: An integer representing the length of the subsequence we want to retain.

### 2. **Objective**:
   - The goal is to return the subsequence of length `k` that has the largest sum. To achieve this, we need to remove elements from `nums` so that only the `k` largest elements remain.

### 3. **While Loop Condition**:
   - The `while len(nums) > k:` loop runs as long as the length of `nums` is greater than `k`. This ensures that we keep removing elements until only `k` elements are left in the list.
   
### 4. **Removing the Minimum Element**:
   - Inside the loop, the line `nums.remove(min(nums))` removes the smallest element from the list. This operation reduces the size of the list by one in each iteration.
   - The `min(nums)` finds the smallest element in the list, and `nums.remove()` removes the first occurrence of this element.

### 5. **Why Removing the Minimum Element?**:
   - To form a subsequence of length `k` with the maximum sum, we remove the smallest elements because the remaining `k` largest elements will naturally provide the largest sum. By removing the smallest values iteratively, we ensure that only the `k` largest values remain.

### 6. **Termination of the Loop**:
   - The loop stops once the length of `nums` becomes equal to `k`, meaning there are exactly `k` elements left in the list. At this point, the list contains the `k` largest elements from the original array.

### 7. **Return Statement**:
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the remaining `nums`, which will be a subsequence of length `k` containing the `k` largest elements from the original list.

### 8. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If `k` is equal to the length of `nums`, the while loop won't run because the condition `len(nums) > k` is false. In this case, the function directly returns the original `nums` list.
   - If `nums` contains duplicates, the code will still work, but it will remove the smallest elements, even if they appear multiple times.

### 9. **Time Complexity**:
   - The `min(nums)` operation takes O(n) time, and the `remove()` operation also takes O(n) time because it has to search for the element to remove.
   - The while loop runs `len(nums) - k` times, so the overall time complexity is O((n - k) * n), where `n` is the length of the original list.

### 10. **Space Complexity**:
   - The space complexity is O(1) since we are modifying the list in-place and only using a constant amount of extra space (excluding the input and output).

### Working Example

#### Input:
```python
nums = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5]
k = 4
```

#### Execution:

- Initial list: `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5]`
- We need to reduce the list to 4 elements, keeping the largest ones.

1. **First Iteration**:
   - The smallest element is `1` (index 1 and 3). We remove the first occurrence of `1`.
   - The list becomes: `[3, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5]`.

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - The smallest element is now `1` (index 2). We remove it.
   - The list becomes: `[3, 4, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5]`.

3. **Third Iteration**:
   - The smallest element is `2` (index 4). We remove it.
   - The list becomes: `[3, 4, 5, 9, 6, 5]`.

4. **Fourth Iteration**:
   - The smallest element is `3` (index 0). We remove it.
   - The list becomes: `[4, 5, 9, 6, 5]`.

Now, the list has exactly 4 elements, which are: `[4, 5, 9, 6]`.

#### Output:
```python
[4, 5, 9, 6]
```
