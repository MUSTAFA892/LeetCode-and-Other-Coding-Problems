## Explanation of Your Code (Line by Line)

### 🔹 Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumBoxes(self, apple: List[int], capacity: List[int]) -> int:
```

**Explanation:**

* You define a class `Solution`.
* Inside it, you define a function `minimumBoxes`.
* The function takes:

  * `apple`: list of apple packs
  * `capacity`: list of box capacities
* It returns an **integer** (minimum number of boxes).

---

```python
        count = 0
```

**Explanation:**

* `count` keeps track of **how many boxes you are using**.
* Initially, you have used **0 boxes**.

---

```python
        capacity.sort(reverse=True)
```

**Explanation:**

* You sort the box capacities in **descending order**.
* This means you use **big boxes first**.
* This helps minimize the number of boxes needed.

📦 Example:
`[2, 5, 3] → [5, 3, 2]`

---

```python
        apple_filled = 0
```

**Explanation:**

* `apple_filled` stores **total space available so far** from selected boxes.
* Initially, no box is chosen, so space = 0.

---

```python
        for i in capacity:
```

**Explanation:**

* You loop through each box capacity (largest first).
* `i` represents the capacity of the current box.

---

```python
            if apple_filled < sum(apple):
```

**Explanation:**

* `sum(apple)` calculates **total apples**.
* This condition checks:

  > “Do I still need more space to store all apples?”

---

```python
                apple_filled += i
```

**Explanation:**

* You add the current box’s capacity to total available space.
* This means you **select this box**.

---

```python
                count += 1
```

**Explanation:**

* Since you selected a box, increase box count by 1.

---

```python
            else:
                break
```

**Explanation:**

* If you already have enough space for all apples,
* Stop selecting more boxes.

---

```python
        return count
```

**Explanation:**

* Return the **minimum number of boxes used**.

## Working Example (Step-by-Step Execution)

### ✅ Test Case

```python
apple = [4, 3, 7]
capacity = [2, 6, 4, 5]
```

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Calculate Total Apples

```
sum(apple) = 4 + 3 + 7 = 14
```

So we need **space ≥ 14**.

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Sort Capacity (Descending)

```
capacity = [6, 5, 4, 2]
```

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Initialize Variables

| Variable     | Value |
| ------------ | ----- |
| apple_filled | 0     |
| count        | 0     |

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Loop Execution

#### ▶ First box (i = 6)

* `apple_filled = 0 < 14` → YES
* Add capacity: `apple_filled = 0 + 6 = 6`
* Increase count: `count = 1`

---

#### ▶ Second box (i = 5)

* `apple_filled = 6 < 14` → YES
* Add capacity: `apple_filled = 6 + 5 = 11`
* Increase count: `count = 2`

---

#### ▶ Third box (i = 4)

* `apple_filled = 11 < 14` → YES
* Add capacity: `apple_filled = 11 + 4 = 15`
* Increase count: `count = 3`

---

#### ▶ Fourth box (i = 2)

* `apple_filled = 15 < 14` → ❌ NO
* `else` → `break` (stop loop)

---

### 🔹 Step 5: Return Result

```
return count → 3
```

---

## ✅ Final Answer

**Minimum boxes needed = 3**
