1. **TreeNode Definition**:
   - A class `TreeNode` is assumed to be defined that represents a node in a binary tree. Each node has a `val` (value), and pointers to `left` and `right` children.

2. **Reverse Odd Levels**:
   - The goal is to reverse the values at **odd levels** (level 1, 3, 5...) of a perfect binary tree. We do this using a **DFS traversal**.

3. **Starting Point**:
   - The function `reverseOddLevels` starts by calling the helper function `_dfs` on the left and right children of the root node, passing the current level as `0`.

4. **Recursive DFS Traversal**:
   - The `_dfs` function is designed to recursively traverse the tree. It accepts two children (`left_child` and `right_child`) at each level, as well as the current level.

5. **Base Case**:
   - If either of the children is `None`, the function returns without doing anything. This is to handle leaf nodes, which do not have children.

6. **Swapping Values at Odd Levels**:
   - The condition `if level % 2 == 0` is used to check if the level is **odd** (since the level starts from 0, it checks for levels 1, 3, 5...).
   - If the current level is odd, it swaps the `val` attributes of the left and right children.

7. **Recursive Calls**:
   - After checking and possibly swapping the node values at the current level, the function proceeds to make recursive calls on the children.
   - The `left_child.right` and `right_child.left` are passed into the next recursive call, which means the function is exploring nodes deeper into the tree.

8. **Increasing Level**:
   - The `level` argument is incremented by 1 in each recursive call, ensuring that the depth of the tree is tracked.

9. **Tree Structure Preservation**:
   - The function performs the value swapping, but it does not modify the tree structure. Only the node values are reversed at odd levels.

10. **End of Traversal**:
    - Once all recursive calls have been made, the tree is processed, and the modified root is returned.

### Working Example:

Let's walk through an example using the following tree:

```
        1
      /   \
     2     3
    / \   / \
   4   5 6   7
```

1. **Starting Point**:
   - The root node is 1.
   - We begin by calling `_dfs(root.left, root.right, level=0)` with nodes `2` (left child of root) and `3` (right child of root) at level 0.

2. **Level 0**:
   - At level 0, there is no swap, since we're only interested in swapping at **odd levels**. So we move to the next recursive calls.

3. **Level 1** (Odd Level):
   - Now we call `_dfs(left_child=4, right_child=7, level=1)`, where nodes 4 and 7 are at level 1.
   - Since it's an odd level (`level % 2 == 1`), we **swap the values** of 4 and 7.
   - After the swap:
     ```
     Node 4's value becomes 7.
     Node 7's value becomes 4.
     ```

4. **Level 2** (Even Level):
   - Now we recurse further and reach level 2. Since it's an even level, we don't swap any values.
   - We call `_dfs(left_child=5, right_child=6, level=2)` and proceed further down.

5. **Level 2 (continued)**:
   - No values are swapped at level 2 because it's an even level. We just proceed down the tree without making any changes.

6. **Returning to Previous Levels**:
   - After the recursion reaches the leaf nodes (level 2), we backtrack through the tree, and the function returns to the root.

7. **Final Tree**:
   After all recursive calls, the tree is updated as follows:

```
        1
      /   \
     2     3
    / \   / \
   7   5 6   4
```
