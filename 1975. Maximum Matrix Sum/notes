# Explanation

### `neg_val = []`

Stores all negative numbers (to count them later).

### `sum_ = 0`

Stores the total sum of matrix elements (converted to absolute form).

### `min_val = float('inf')`

Tracks the **smallest absolute value** in the matrix.

---

## 🔁 Loop through every element

```python
for i in range(len(matrix)):
    for j in range(len(matrix[0])):
```

This visits each element one-by-one.

---

## 🟥 If number is negative

```python
if matrix[i][j] < 0:
    neg_val.append(matrix[i][j])
    matrix[i][j] = -(matrix[i][j])
```

### Meaning:

✔ store the negative
✔ convert it into positive (absolute value)

So now all values become positive in the matrix.

---

## ➕ Add to sum

```python
sum_ += matrix[i][j]
```

Now you are summing **absolute values**.

---

## 🔍 Track minimum absolute value

```python
min_val = min(min_val, matrix[i][j])
```

Because this value matters if negatives are odd.

---

# ✅ After the loop finishes

### Check if the count of negatives is odd

```python
if len(neg_val) % 2 != 0:
```

✔ If even → all signs can become positive
✔ If odd → one value must stay negative

---

## 🧮 Adjust answer if odd

```python
return sum_ - (2 * min_val)
```

Why subtract `2 × min_val`?

Because earlier we counted it as **+min_val**,
but it must actually be **−min_val**.

Difference:

```
+min_val  →  -min_val
change = 2 × min_val
```

So we subtract it.

---

## 🎉 If negatives were even

```python
return sum_
```

Everything can be positive
→ sum of absolute values is the answer.

# 🧪 Working Example (Step-by-Step)

### Matrix:

```
[
 [ 1,  2,  3],
 [-1, -2, -3],
 [ 1,  2,  3]
]
```

## 🔎 Step 1 — Loop and process elements

| Value | Negative? | Converted To | Add To Sum | Smallest? | Negatives List |
| ----- | --------- | ------------ | ---------- | --------- | -------------- |
| 1     | No        | 1            | sum = 1    | min = 1   | []             |
| 2     | No        | 2            | sum = 3    | min = 1   | []             |
| 3     | No        | 3            | sum = 6    | min = 1   | []             |
| -1    | Yes       | 1            | sum = 7    | min = 1   | [-1]           |
| -2    | Yes       | 2            | sum = 9    | min = 1   | [-1,-2]        |
| -3    | Yes       | 3            | sum = 12   | min = 1   | [-1,-2,-3]     |
| 1     | No        | 1            | sum = 13   | min = 1   | [-1,-2,-3]     |
| 2     | No        | 2            | sum = 15   | min = 1   | [-1,-2,-3]     |
| 3     | No        | 3            | sum = 18   | min = 1   | [-1,-2,-3]     |

---

## 📊 Now we have:

```
sum_ = 18
negatives = 3 (odd)
min_val = 1
```

---

## 🚦 Since negatives are odd

We must leave one number negative.

So:

```
answer = 18 − 2×1
answer = 18 − 2
answer = 16
```

---

# ✅ Final Answer = **16**

Which matches the theory 👍

# 🟢 Another Example (Even Negatives)

### Matrix:

```
[ [-1, 2],
  [-3, 4] ]
```

Negatives:

```
-1, -3  → count = 2 (even)
```

Absolute sum:

```
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10
```

Since negatives are even:

```
return 10
```

✔ All values can become positive
✔ No subtraction needed
