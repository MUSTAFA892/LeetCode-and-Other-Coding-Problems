## Explanation Notes

### 🔸 `Node` Class

Same as before, represents each element in the list:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
```

---

### 🔸 `Linked` Class

#### 🔹 Attributes:

* `head`: Start of the linked list
* `length`: Number of nodes (⚠️ Initialized to `1`, which can cause incorrect results)
* `middle_index`: Stores index of middle
* `middle_element`: Stores value of the middle node

---

### 🔹 `insert(data)`

* Inserts node at the beginning (head-first insertion)
* This method **does not update `length`**, which is a bug
* Should add `self.length += 1` here

---

### 🔹 `traverse()`

* Prints the linked list
* Increments `length` during traversal (⚠️ Bug: length should not be updated here)
* Every time `traverse()` is called, length increases even without inserting new nodes

**Fix Suggestion:**

* Move `self.length += 1` into `insert()` only
* Set `length = 0` during initialization

---

### 🔹 `get_length()`

* Returns the length

---

### 🔹 `middle_value()`

Logic:

1. Calculates `middle_index = length // 2`
2. Walks through the list using a counter
3. When the counter equals `middle_index + 1`, it saves the current node's data as the middle
4. Prints the middle element

✅ This logic is correct for 1-based tracking (`track_length = 1`)

### ⚠️ Bugs to Fix (in your code):

| Problem                            | Why it's an issue                            | Fix                                                |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `length = 1`                       | Even before inserting any nodes, length is 1 | Set `self.length = 0` in `__init__`                |
| `self.length += 1` in `traverse()` | This causes incorrect length when printing   | Remove it from `traverse()`, move it to `insert()` |

---

## ✅ Final Correct Behavior (After Fixes)

### If inputs are:

```python
insert(1)
insert(2)
insert(5)
insert(4)
insert(7)
insert(9)
```

Then printed list is:

```
9 -> 7 -> 4 -> 5 -> 2 -> 1 -> None
```

Length:

```
6
```

Middle element:

```
5  (because 6//2 = 3, so the 4th node from head = 5)
```
