### Explanation:

1. **Sorting the String in Reverse Order**:
   - The string `s` is first sorted in descending order to prioritize the lexicographically larger characters. Sorting helps ensure that the largest possible string is formed.

2. **Initializing Variables**:
   - `result`: This list will store the characters of the final string.
   - `freq`: This tracks how many times the current character appears consecutively in the result. It starts at 1 because the first character is added to the result.
   - `pointer`: This pointer helps find the next available character when the current character exceeds the repeat limit.

3. **Iterating through the Sorted Characters**:
   - We loop through each character in the sorted string `char`. The loop will handle building the result step by step.

4. **Checking if the Last Character in Result is the Same**:
   - If the last character in `result` is the same as the current character (`char[i]`), we need to check if the character has already appeared up to the `repeatLimit` times. If so, we skip adding that character and move forward.

5. **Adding Characters While Respecting the `repeatLimit`**:
   - If the consecutive occurrences (`freq`) are less than the `repeatLimit`, we append the character to the result and increment the `freq` to keep track of consecutive occurrences.

6. **Handling the Case Where the `repeatLimit` is Reached**:
   - If the frequency (`freq`) reaches the `repeatLimit`, we move the pointer forward to find the next character that is different, skipping over characters that are the same as the current one to avoid exceeding the `repeatLimit`.

7. **Replacing the Character When Necessary**:
   - Once we find a character different from the current one, we append it to the result and reset `freq` to 1. We also swap the positions of the characters in the sorted list to avoid reusing the same character.

8. **Breaking If No More Characters Are Available**:
   - If no other valid characters are found (i.e., `pointer` reaches the end of the string), the loop is terminated.

9. **Handling Characters That Are Not Repeated**:
   - If the current character isn't repeated consecutively in the result, we simply append it and reset `freq` to 1.

10. **Returning the Final String**:
    - After completing the loop, the `result` list contains the final string. The list is then joined into a single string and returned.

### Example Walkthrough:

Consider the input:
```python
s = "cczazcc"
repeatLimit = 3
```

1. **Sorted String**:
   - We first sort the string `s` in descending order: `char = ['z', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'a', 'z']`.

2. **First Iteration (i = 0)**:
   - We add the first character `'z'` to the result.
   - `result = ['z']`, `freq = 1`

3. **Second Iteration (i = 1)**:
   - The next character is `'c'`. We append it to the result since itâ€™s different from the last added character.
   - `result = ['z', 'c']`, `freq = 1`

4. **Third Iteration (i = 2)**:
   - The next character is also `'c'`. We can add it since `freq < repeatLimit`.
   - `result = ['z', 'c', 'c']`, `freq = 2`

5. **Fourth Iteration (i = 3)**:
   - The next character is `'c'`. We add it since `freq < repeatLimit`.
   - `result = ['z', 'c', 'c', 'c']`, `freq = 3`

6. **Fifth Iteration (i = 4)**:
   - The next character is `'c'`, but it exceeds the `repeatLimit` of 3. 
   - We move the pointer to find a different character (`'a'`), append it, and reset `freq` to 1.
   - `result = ['z', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'a']`, `freq = 1`

7. **Sixth Iteration (i = 5)**:
   - The next character is `'z'`, but it has already been added to the result. Therefore, the loop terminates.
   - Final result is `"zzcccac"`.

### Final Output:
```text
zzcccac
```
