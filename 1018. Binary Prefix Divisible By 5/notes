# 📘 **DETAILED NOTES — Prefixes Divisible by 5**

---

# 🔥 **1. Goal of the problem**

Given a binary array `nums`, for each prefix:

```
nums[0 : i]
```

Check **whether the binary number formed is divisible by 5**.

We must return a list like:

```
[True, False, True, ...]
```

where each value tells:

* TRUE  → The prefix forms a binary number divisible by 5
* FALSE → Not divisible

---

# 💡 **2. Why not convert to full decimal?**

Binary numbers grow very fast:

```
101010111011101011...
```

This could easily become a number with **hundreds of bits** → too large for normal integers.

So we **do NOT** convert prefix binary into a normal integer.

Instead, we use **remainder logic**, which is always small (0 to 4).

---

# 🧠 **3. Mathematical foundation**

A binary prefix works like this:

### If old number = X

### New number = X * 2 + current_bit

Example:

* Old: `101` → decimal = 5
* New bit: `1`
* New number: `5 * 2 + 1 = 11`

This rule is **always true** for binary numbers.

---

# 🔑 **4. Remainder Trick**

Instead of storing the WHOLE number,
we only store:

```
remainder when divided by 5
```

Let:

```
rem = (previous_number % 5)
```

Then:

```
new_number % 5 = (previous_number * 2 + current_bit) % 5
               = (rem * 2 + current_bit) % 5
```

So this:

```
rem = (rem * 2 + nums[i]) % 5
```

gives us the **new remainder** without ever computing the full number!

---

# 🎯 **5. Output rule**

After updating `rem`:

```
if rem == 0:
    prefix is divisible by 5 → append True
else:
    append False
```

Why?

* If remainder is 0 → perfectly divisible
* Otherwise not divisible

Simple and perfect.

# 🧪 **6. FULL WALKTHROUGH EXAMPLE**

Let:

```
nums = [1, 0, 1, 1]
```

We'll track:

* prefix (binary)
* decimal meaning
* remainder after dividing by 5

---

### **Initialize**

```
rem = 0
ans = []
```

---

### **i = 0, bit = 1**

```
rem = (0 * 2 + 1) % 5 = 1
```

Prefix: `1`
Decimal: 1
1 % 5 = 1 → ❌ Not divisible

```
ans = [False]
```

---

### **i = 1, bit = 0**

```
rem = (1 * 2 + 0) % 5 = 2
```

Prefix: `10`
Decimal: 2
2 % 5 = 2 → ❌

```
ans = [False, False]
```

---

### **i = 2, bit = 1**

```
rem = (2 * 2 + 1) % 5 = 5 % 5 = 0
```

Prefix: `101`
Decimal: 5
5 % 5 = 0 → ✔ Divisible

```
ans = [False, False, True]
```

---

### **i = 3, bit = 1**

```
rem = (0 * 2 + 1) % 5 = 1
```

Prefix: `1011`
Decimal: 11
11 % 5 = 1 → ❌

```
ans = [False, False, True, False]
```

---

# 🟢 **7. Final Output**

```
[False, False, True, False]
```
