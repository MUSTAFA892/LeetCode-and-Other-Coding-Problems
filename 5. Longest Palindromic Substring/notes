1. **`class Solution:`**
   - Defines the class `Solution` which contains the method `longestPalindrome`.

2. **`def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:`**
   - Defines the function `longestPalindrome` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the longest palindromic substring within it.

3. **`res = ""`**
   - Initializes `res` as an empty string. This will hold the result—the longest palindromic substring found so far.

4. **`resLen = 0`**
   - Initializes `resLen` as `0`. This keeps track of the length of the longest palindrome found so far.

5. **`for i in range(len(s)):`**
   - Loops through each character in the string `s` using its index `i`.

6. **First Expansion: Center at Single Character (`l, r = i, i`)**
   - **`l, r = i, i`**: Sets `l` (left pointer) and `r` (right pointer) both to `i`, meaning we are treating the current character `s[i]` as the center of a potential odd-length palindrome.
   - **`while l >= 0 and r < len(s) and s[l] == s[r]:`**
     - This loop expands outwards as long as the characters at `l` and `r` are the same (checking for palindrome).
     - The loop ensures that the expansion stays within the bounds of the string (`l >= 0` and `r < len(s)`).
   - **`if (r - l + 1) > resLen:`**
     - If the current palindrome (length `r - l + 1`) is longer than the previously found longest palindrome (`resLen`), we update the result:
     - **`res = s[l:r+1]`**: Updates `res` with the current palindrome substring.
     - **`resLen = r - l + 1`**: Updates the length of the longest palindrome found so far.
   - **`l -= 1` and `r += 1`**: Expands the window outward by decrementing `l` (moving left) and incrementing `r` (moving right).

7. **Second Expansion: Center Between Two Characters (`l, r = i, i + 1`)**
   - **`l, r = i, i + 1`**: Sets `l` to `i` and `r` to `i + 1`, treating the center as a pair of characters (checking for even-length palindromes).
   - The same process of expanding outward, checking if the characters at `l` and `r` are equal, and updating the result if a longer palindrome is found happens here, just like in the first expansion.

8. **`return res`**
   - Once the loop has checked all possible centers (both single and pairs of characters), the function returns the longest palindrome found (`res`).

### Example Walkthrough: Input `"babad"`

Let's walk through how the code works with an example where `s = "babad"`.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - `res = ""`
   - `resLen = 0`

2. **First loop iteration (`i = 0`):**
   - The first character is `"b"`.

   - **Odd-length palindrome check:**
     - Set `l = 0`, `r = 0`.
     - Expand outward: `s[l] == s[r]` → `"b" == "b"`.
     - Update `res = "b"`, `resLen = 1`.
     - Try to expand further: `l = -1` (out of bounds), so exit the loop.

   - **Even-length palindrome check:**
     - Set `l = 0`, `r = 1`.
     - `s[l] != s[r]` → `"b" != "a"`, so exit the loop.

3. **Second loop iteration (`i = 1`):**
   - The second character is `"a"`.

   - **Odd-length palindrome check:**
     - Set `l = 1`, `r = 1`.
     - `s[l] == s[r]` → `"a" == "a"`.
     - Update `res = "a"`, `resLen = 1` (no change since it's still length 1).
     - Try to expand further: `l = 0`, `r = 2`, `s[l] == s[r]` → `"b" == "b"`.
     - Update `res = "bab"`, `resLen = 3` (we found a longer palindrome).
     - Try to expand further: `l = -1` (out of bounds), so exit the loop.

   - **Even-length palindrome check:**
     - Set `l = 1`, `r = 2`.
     - `s[l] != s[r]` → `"a" != "b"`, so exit the loop.

4. **Third loop iteration (`i = 2`):**
   - The third character is `"b"`.

   - **Odd-length palindrome check:**
     - Set `l = 2`, `r = 2`.
     - `s[l] == s[r]` → `"b" == "b"`.
     - No update to `res` because `resLen` is still 3.
     - Try to expand further: `l = 1`, `r = 3`, `s[l] == s[r]` → `"a" == "a"`.
     - Update `res = "aba"`, `resLen = 3` (same length as "bab").
     - Try to expand further: `l = 0`, `r = 4`, `s[l] != s[r]` → `"b" != "d"`, so exit the loop.

   - **Even-length palindrome check:**
     - Set `l = 2`, `r = 3`.
     - `s[l] != s[r]` → `"b" != "a"`, so exit the loop.

5. **Fourth loop iteration (`i = 3`):**
   - The fourth character is `"a"`.

   - **Odd-length palindrome check:**
     - Set `l = 3`, `r = 3`.
     - `s[l] == s[r]` → `"a" == "a"`, but no update to `res` since the palindrome length is not greater than 3.
     - Expand further: `l = 2`, `r = 4`, `s[l] != s[r]` → `"b" != "d"`, so exit the loop.

   - **Even-length palindrome check:**
     - Set `l = 3`, `r = 4`.
     - `s[l] != s[r]` → `"a" != "d"`, so exit the loop.

6. **Fifth loop iteration (`i = 4`):**
   - The fifth character is `"d"`.

   - **Odd-length palindrome check:**
     - Set `l = 4`, `r = 4`.
     - `s[l] == s[r]` → `"d" == "d"`.
     - No update to `res` because the length of the palindrome is not greater than 3.
     - Try to expand further: `l = 3`, `r = 5` (out of bounds), so exit the loop.

   - **Even-length palindrome check:**
     - Set `l = 4`, `r = 5` (out of bounds), so exit the loop.

### Final Result: `"bab"` or `"aba"`

After iterating through the string, the function identifies either `"bab"` or `"aba"` as the longest palindromic substring (both are of length 3).
