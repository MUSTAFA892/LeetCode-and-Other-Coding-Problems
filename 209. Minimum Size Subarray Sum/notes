1. **Function Purpose**:
   - The goal is to find the length of the smallest contiguous subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to a given `target`. If no such subarray exists, return `0`.

2. **Initial Variables**:
   - `left = 0`: A pointer to the beginning of the subarray. It will help in shrinking the window.
   - `sum_ = 0`: The current sum of the elements in the window defined by `left` and `right`.
   - `min_len = float('inf')`: Keeps track of the minimum length of the subarray that satisfies the condition (`sum >= target`). Initially set to infinity because we are looking for the smallest possible length.

3. **Main Logic - Sliding Window Approach**:
   - We use a sliding window to explore all possible subarrays in `nums`.
   - The `right` pointer moves through each element in the array, adding it to the current `sum_`.
   - If `sum_ >= target`, it means the current window satisfies the condition, so we check if the window's length (`right - left + 1`) is smaller than the current `min_len`. If so, update `min_len`.
   - To potentially find a smaller valid subarray, we move the `left` pointer to the right, shrinking the window and subtracting the elements that go out of the window, thus decreasing `sum_`.

4. **Termination Condition**:
   - Once the loop finishes, if `min_len` was updated from infinity, return the `min_len`, which represents the smallest subarray length.
   - If `min_len` remains infinity, it means no subarray with sum `>= target` was found, so we return `0`.

5. **Time Complexity**:
   - The algorithm runs in O(n), where `n` is the length of `nums`, because both the `left` and `right` pointers only traverse the array once.

6. **Sliding Window Insight**:
   - The sliding window approach dynamically adjusts the size of the subarray by expanding and shrinking the window, ensuring that we check all possible subarrays without redundant calculations.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `nums` is empty or no valid subarray exists (i.e., all elements are smaller than `target`), return `0`.
   - If the sum of the entire array is greater than or equal to `target`, the whole array could be the answer.

8. **Efficiency**:
   - The sliding window technique ensures an efficient search for the smallest subarray that meets the condition, without having to check every possible subarray explicitly.

9. **Result Calculation**:
   - After processing the entire array, the minimum length of a valid subarray is either the smallest found subarray length or `0` if no valid subarray exists.

10. **Greedy Choice**:
    - Every time a valid subarray is found, we greedily shrink the window from the left side to try to minimize the subarray length while still maintaining the sum condition.

### Example Walkthrough:

Letâ€™s walk through an example to demonstrate the function:

#### Example 1:
```python
target = 7
nums = [2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 3]
```

**Step-by-step process:**

1. `target = 7`
2. Initialize `left = 0`, `sum_ = 0`, and `min_len = infinity`.
   
   - **First iteration** (`right = 0`): `sum_ += nums[0] = 2`. Now `sum_ = 2`, which is less than `target`.
   - **Second iteration** (`right = 1`): `sum_ += nums[1] = 3`. Now `sum_ = 5`, which is still less than `target`.
   - **Third iteration** (`right = 2`): `sum_ += nums[2] = 1`. Now `sum_ = 6`, still less than `target`.
   - **Fourth iteration** (`right = 3`): `sum_ += nums[3] = 2`. Now `sum_ = 8`, which is greater than or equal to `target`.
     - We update `min_len = min(min_len, right - left + 1) = min(inf, 3 - 0 + 1) = 4`.
     - Now, shrink the window by moving `left` to 1. Subtract `nums[0]` from `sum_`: `sum_ -= nums[0] = 6`.
     - **Fifth iteration** (`right = 4`): `sum_ += nums[4] = 4`. Now `sum_ = 10`, still greater than or equal to `target`.
       - We update `min_len = min(min_len, right - left + 1) = min(4, 4 - 1 + 1) = 4`.
       - Shrink the window again by moving `left` to 2. Subtract `nums[1]` from `sum_`: `sum_ -= nums[1] = 7`.
     - **Sixth iteration** (`right = 5`): `sum_ += nums[5] = 3`. Now `sum_ = 10`, greater than or equal to `target`.
       - We update `min_len = min(min_len, right - left + 1) = min(4, 5 - 2 + 1) = 4`.
       - Shrink the window by moving `left` to 3. Subtract `nums[2]` from `sum_`: `sum_ -= nums[2] = 6`.
   
3. After processing all the elements, the minimum length of the subarray that satisfies the condition is `min_len = 4`.

**Output**: `4`
