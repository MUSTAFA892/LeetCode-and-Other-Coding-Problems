# 🧠 **Code Explanation (Line-by-Line)**

```python
while original in nums:
```

* Check whether the current value of `original` is present in the nums array.
* If yes, then you must double it.

```python
    original = original * 2
```

* Double the value of `original`.
* Continue checking again with the updated value.

```python
return original
```

* As soon as a value is found that does NOT exist in the array, return that value.

# 🔍 **Working Example**

### Input:

```
nums = [2, 7, 9, 4, 1]
original = 2
```

### Step-by-step:

---

### **Step 1**

Check:

```
Is 2 in nums? → Yes
```

So update:

```
original = 2 * 2 = 4
```

---

### **Step 2**

Check:

```
Is 4 in nums? → Yes
```

Update:

```
original = 4 * 2 = 8
```

---

### **Step 3**

Check:

```
Is 8 in nums? → No
```

So we **stop** and return `8`.

---

# 🎉 Final Output:

```
8
```
