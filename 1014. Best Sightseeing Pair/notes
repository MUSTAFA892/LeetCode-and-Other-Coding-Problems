1. **Problem Overview:**
   - The goal is to find two indices `i` and `j` in the `values` array such that the sum `values[i] + values[j] + i - j` is maximized, where `i < j`.
   - The expression `values[i] + values[j] + i - j` represents the score for sightseeing pairs, where the value of a sightseeing pair depends on their respective values and their distance.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - `max_ = 0`: This variable will store the maximum score encountered during the iteration.
   - `max_left = values[0]`: This variable stores the highest possible value for the first part of the score (`values[i] + i`) as we iterate through the array.

3. **Iterating through the list:**
   - The loop starts at index `1` (`for i in range(1, len(values))`), because `max_left` is initialized with the first element (`values[0]`).

4. **Updating the Maximum Score:**
   - Inside the loop, the score is calculated for each pair `i` and `j`. The current score for a pair is calculated as:
     ```
     max_ = max(max_, max_left + values[i] - i)
     ```
     This checks if the current pair's score (using `max_left`, which represents the best `values[k] + k` for all previous `k`) is greater than the previously stored maximum score.

5. **Updating max_left:**
   - After checking the score, we update `max_left` to store the maximum value of `values[k] + k` encountered so far:
     ```
     max_left = max(max_left, values[i] + i)
     ```
     This ensures that for every new index `i`, we can calculate the maximum possible `values[k] + k` for all `k < i`.

6. **Handling Negative Indices:**
   - Since we're working with the indices, the difference between `i` and `j` is handled in the formula `values[i] + values[j] + i - j` automatically by the loop iteration.

7. **Time Complexity:**
   - The algorithm runs in `O(n)` time because it only iterates through the list once, making it efficient for large inputs.

8. **Space Complexity:**
   - The space complexity is `O(1)`, since the algorithm uses a fixed amount of extra space for variables like `max_` and `max_left`.

9. **Key Insight:**
   - The critical insight of this algorithm is recognizing that `values[i] + i` can be precomputed for all `i`, and by maintaining the maximum of these values so far, we can efficiently calculate the optimal score for any `j` as the loop proceeds.

10. **Final Result:**
    - The variable `max_` holds the maximum sightseeing pair score at the end of the loop, which is returned as the result.

### Working Example:

#### Input:

```python
values = [8, 1, 5, 2, 6]
```

#### Step-by-step:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `max_ = 0`
   - `max_left = values[0] = 8`

2. **First iteration (`i = 1`):**
   - Current score: `max_left + values[1] - 1 = 8 + 1 - 1 = 8`
   - Update `max_ = max(0, 8) = 8`
   - Update `max_left = max(8, 1 + 1) = 8`

3. **Second iteration (`i = 2`):**
   - Current score: `max_left + values[2] - 2 = 8 + 5 - 2 = 11`
   - Update `max_ = max(8, 11) = 11`
   - Update `max_left = max(8, 5 + 2) = 8`

4. **Third iteration (`i = 3`):**
   - Current score: `max_left + values[3] - 3 = 8 + 2 - 3 = 7`
   - `max_` remains unchanged (`max_ = 11`)
   - Update `max_left = max(8, 2 + 3) = 8`

5. **Fourth iteration (`i = 4`):**
   - Current score: `max_left + values[4] - 4 = 8 + 6 - 4 = 10`
   - `max_` remains unchanged (`max_ = 11`)
   - Update `max_left = max(8, 6 + 4) = 10`

6. **Final result:**
   - `max_ = 11`

#### Output:

```python
11
```

In this example, the maximum sightseeing score is 11, which occurs between the pair `(i = 0, j = 2)` where `values[0] = 8` and `values[2] = 5`.
