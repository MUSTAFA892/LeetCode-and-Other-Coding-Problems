1. **Class Definition**: The class `Solution` is defined, following the structure commonly used in coding problems like LeetCode.

2. **Method Definition**: Inside the class, the method `twoSum` is defined, which takes two arguments:
   - `numbers`: A list of integers (`List[int]`), assumed to be sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - `target`: The target integer that the sum of two numbers should equal.

3. **Two-pointer Approach**: Two pointers are initialized:
   - `left` starts at the beginning of the list (`0`).
   - `right` starts at the end of the list (`len(numbers) - 1`).

4. **While Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `left < right`. This ensures that the pointers move inward toward each other without overlapping.

5. **Sum Calculation**: Inside the loop, the sum of the elements at the `left` and `right` pointers is stored in the variable `total`:
   ```python
   total = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
   ```

6. **Target Check**:
   - If `total == target`, the indices of the two elements are returned as `left+1` and `right+1` (1-based indexing as required in certain coding problems).
   - `left+1` and `right+1` adjust the 0-based indices to 1-based indexing.

7. **Break Condition**: Once the target is found and the values are returned, the loop breaks, though the `break` statement is unnecessary after `return`.

8. **Move Right Pointer**: If the sum `total` is greater than the `target`, it means the current pair of numbers are too large. The `right` pointer is decremented (`right -= 1`) to reduce the sum:
   ```python
   elif total > target:
       right -= 1
   ```

9. **Move Left Pointer**: If the sum `total` is less than the `target`, it means the current pair of numbers are too small. The `left` pointer is incremented (`left += 1`) to increase the sum:
   ```python
   else:
       left += 1
   ```

10. **Efficiency**: The method uses a two-pointer approach, which takes advantage of the sorted nature of the list. This results in an efficient \(O(n)\) time complexity, as the list is traversed only once from both ends.

This implementation efficiently solves the two-sum problem using a two-pointer approach on a sorted list, providing a clean and fast solution.
