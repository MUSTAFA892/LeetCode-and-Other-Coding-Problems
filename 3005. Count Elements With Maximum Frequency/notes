## ðŸ”Ž What the Problem Usually Asks

The **LeetCode problem "Count Elements With Maximum Frequency"** asks:

* Youâ€™re given an array `nums`.
* Find the **maximum frequency** of any element.
* Then count **how many times all the most frequent elements appear in total**.

ðŸ‘‰ In short: If multiple numbers appear with the same highest frequency, return the total count of their occurrences.

## ðŸ›  Step-by-Step Code Explanation

1. **Count frequency of each number**

   ```python
   freq = Counter(nums)
   ```

   Example:
   `nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4]`
   Then:
   `freq = {1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 1}`

2. **Find the maximum frequency**

   ```python
   max_freq = max(freq.values())
   ```

   Here:
   `max_freq = 2` (because both `1` and `2` appear twice)

3. **Initialize a helper variable**

   ```python
   max_ = max_freq
   ```

   So `max_ = 2`.

4. **Loop over all frequencies**

   ```python
   for i in freq.values():
       if max_freq == i:
           max_ += i
   ```

   * For `i = 2`: condition true â†’ `max_ = 2 + 2 = 4`
   * For `i = 2`: condition true again â†’ `max_ = 4 + 2 = 6`
   * For `i = 1`: skip
   * For `i = 1`: skip

5. **Final adjustment**

   ```python
   return max_ - max_freq
   ```

   Since we added `max_freq` at the start unnecessarily, this subtracts it once.
   â†’ `6 - 2 = 4`

âœ… Output = `4`

Which is correct, because the most frequent elements are `1` and `2`, and together they occur **2 + 2 = 4 times**.

## ðŸ§ª Another Example

Input:

```python
nums = [5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7]
```

* Step 1: `freq = {5: 2, 6: 3, 7: 1}`
* Step 2: `max_freq = 3`
* Step 3: `max_ = 3`
* Loop:

  * `i = 2` â†’ skip
  * `i = 3` â†’ `max_ = 3 + 3 = 6`
  * `i = 1` â†’ skip
* Final return: `6 - 3 = 3`

âœ… Answer = `3`, because the most frequent element is `6` (appears 3 times).
