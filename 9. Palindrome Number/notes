1. **Convert the integer to a string**:
   ```python
   a = str(x)
   ```
   - This converts the input integer `x` into its string representation `a`.
   - For example, if `x = 121`, `a` will be `"121"`.
   - This step is necessary because checking for a palindrome can be easily done with string manipulation.

2. **Check if the string is equal to its reverse**:
   ```python
   return str(x) == a[::-1]
   ```
   - `a[::-1]` is a Pythonic way to reverse a string. The slicing operation `[::-1]` takes all the characters of `a` and reverses their order.
   - The function then compares the original string `str(x)` with its reversed version.
   - If they are the same, it means the integer is a palindrome, and the function returns `True`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Example 1: 
- Input: `x = 121`
  - `a = "121"`, and `a[::-1]` is also `"121"`.
  - Since both are equal, the function returns `True`.

### Example 2:
- Input: `x = -121`
  - `a = "-121"`, and `a[::-1]` is `"121-"`.
  - Since `"-121"` is not equal to `"121-"`, the function returns `False`.

### Example 3:
- Input: `x = 10`
  - `a = "10"`, and `a[::-1]` is `"01"`.
  - Since `"10"` is not equal to `"01"`, the function returns `False`.
