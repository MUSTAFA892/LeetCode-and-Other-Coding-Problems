1. **Purpose of the Method**:  
   The `findTheDifference` method takes two strings, `s` and `t`, and returns the character that is different (i.e., the extra character present in `t` but not in `s`).

2. **Use of `Counter`**:  
   The `Counter` from the `collections` module counts the occurrences of each character in both strings:
   - `s_ = Counter(s)` creates a `Counter` for string `s`.
   - `t_ = Counter(t)` creates a `Counter` for string `t`.

3. **Finding the Difference**:  
   - `diff = t_ - s_` subtracts the counts of characters in `s_` from `t_`. The result is a `Counter` containing the extra character(s) in `t` that are not in `s`.

4. **Extracting the Extra Character**:  
   - `list(diff.keys())[0]` converts the keys of `diff` to a list and gets the first character (since there's only one extra character).

5. **Return Value**:  
   The method returns the extra character found in `t`.

### Working Example

#### Example 1

```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        s_ = Counter(s)
        t_ = Counter(t)
        diff = t_ - s_
        return list(diff.keys())[0]

# Test Case
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

solution = Solution()
print(solution.findTheDifference(s, t))
```

**Explanation**:
- `s = "abcd"` → `Counter(s)` becomes `Counter({'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1, 'd': 1})`
- `t = "abcde"` → `Counter(t)` becomes `Counter({'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1, 'd': 1, 'e': 1})`
- `t_ - s_` results in `Counter({'e': 1})`
- The method returns `'e'`

**Output**:
```
e
```

---

#### Example 2

```python
s = "aabb"
t = "aabbc"

solution = Solution()
print(solution.findTheDifference(s, t))
```

**Explanation**:
- `s = "aabb"` → `Counter(s)` becomes `Counter({'a': 2, 'b': 2})`
- `t = "aabbc"` → `Counter(t)` becomes `Counter({'a': 2, 'b': 2, 'c': 1})`
- `t_ - s_` results in `Counter({'c': 1})`
- The method returns `'c'`

**Output**:
```
c
```

### Edge Cases

1. **Single Extra Character**:
   ```python
   s = ""
   t = "x"
   print(solution.findTheDifference(s, t))  # Output: 'x'
   ```

2. **Characters in Different Orders**:
   ```python
   s = "xyz"
   t = "yxzw"
   print(solution.findTheDifference(s, t))  # Output: 'w'
   ```
