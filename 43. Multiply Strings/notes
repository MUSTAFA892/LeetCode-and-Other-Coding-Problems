# Explanation (First Approach)

## Step 1️⃣

```python
mul_val = []
```

This will store all **partial multiplication results**, similar to what we do manually on paper.

---

## Step 2️⃣ — Loop through digits of num2

```python
for i in range(len(num2)):
    zeros = (len(num2)-1)-i
    mul_val.append(str(int(num2[i])*int(num1))+'0'*zeros)
```

For each digit in `num2`:

1. Convert digit → integer
2. Multiply it with the **entire num1**
3. Add trailing zeros based on its digit position

This mimics manual multiplication like:

```
   num1
x  num2
---------
 partial results
```

Trailing zeros = place value.

---

## Step 3️⃣ — Add all partial results

```python
product_val = 0
for i in mul_val:
    product_val += int(i)
```

Sum everything.

---

## Step 4️⃣ — Return as string

```python
return str(product_val)
```

---

# 📌 Example Test Case

Let’s take:

```
num1 = "12"
num2 = "34"
```

So we compute:

```
12 × 34 = 408
```

Let’s see how your code arrives at this.

---

# 🔍 Detailed Working

`num2 = "34"`

Digits (by index):

```
i = 0 → '3'
i = 1 → '4'
```

Length = 2

---

## ⭐ Iteration 1

`i = 0`

```
digit = '3'
zeros = (2-1)-0 = 1
```

Multiply:

```
3 × 12 = 36
```

Add 1 zero:

```
"36" + "0" = "360"
```

Store:

```
mul_val = ["360"]
```

---

## ⭐ Iteration 2

`i = 1`

```
digit = '4'
zeros = (2-1)-1 = 0
```

Multiply:

```
4 × 12 = 48
```

Add 0 zeros:

```
"48"
```

Store:

```
mul_val = ["360","48"]
```

---

# ➕ Sum Partial Results

```
360
+ 48
----
408
```

So:

```
product_val = 408
```

Return `"408"`

---

# 🎉 Final Output

```
"408"
```

# Explanation — Second Approach

1. **Class Definition**

   ```python
   class Solution:
   ```

   * This defines a class named `Solution`.
   * The multiplication function is written inside this class.

---

2. **Method Definition**

   ```python
   def multiply(self, num1: str, num2: str) -> str:
   ```

   * `multiply` is a method belonging to the `Solution` class.
   * Parameters:

     * `self` → reference to the current object
     * `num1` → first number as a string
     * `num2` → second number as a string
   * `-> str` means the method will return a **string**.

---

3. **Conversion to Integers and Multiplication**

   ```python
   mul = int(num1) * int(num2)
   ```

   * `int(num1)` converts the string `num1` into an integer.
   * `int(num2)` converts the string `num2` into an integer.
   * The two integers are multiplied.
   * The result is stored in the variable `mul`.

---

4. **Convert Result Back to String and Return**

   ```python
   return str(mul)
   ```

   * `str(mul)` converts the numeric result back into a string.
   * This string is returned as the final answer.

---

# 🔍 Example

If:

```
num1 = "3"
num2 = "4"
```

Then:

```
int(num1) = 3
int(num2) = 4
3 × 4 = 12
```

Convert back to string:

```
"12"
```

So the function returns:

```
"12"
```
