1. **`if target in nums:`**:
   - The code uses Python's built-in `in` operator, which checks if the `target` is present in the list `nums`.
   - The `in` operator performs a **linear search** under the hood, meaning it goes through each element of `nums` from the start to the end until it either finds the `target` or reaches the end of the list.

2. **Return `True` if target is found**:
   - If the `target` is found in the list using `in`, it returns `True`.

3. **Return `False` if target is not found**:
   - If the `target` is not found, the `in` operator evaluates to `False`, and the function returns `False`.

### Working Example:

#### Example 1:

**Input:**
```python
nums = [4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]
target = 6
```

**Step-by-Step Execution:**
1. The array `nums` is: `[4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]`.
2. We want to check if the `target` (6) is present in `nums`.
3. The `in` operator performs a linear search, starting from the first element (`4`), then moves to `5`, and finally reaches `6`.
4. Since `6` is found in `nums`, the condition `target in nums` evaluates to `True`.
5. The function returns `True`.

**Output:**
```python
True
```
