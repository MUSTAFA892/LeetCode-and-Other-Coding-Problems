1. **Class Definition**: The `Solution` class contains a method `isPrefixOfWord` that checks if the given `searchWord` is a prefix of any word in the `sentence`.

2. **Method Definition**: `isPrefixOfWord(self, sentence: str, searchWord: str) -> int`:  
   - This method takes two parameters:
     - `sentence`: A string containing a sentence of words.
     - `searchWord`: A string that we need to check if it is a prefix of any word in `sentence`.

3. **Splitting the Sentence**:  
   The `split` variable is created by splitting the `sentence` into a list of words using the `.split()` method. The `split()` method divides the sentence by spaces and returns a list of individual words.

4. **Iterating Through the Words**:  
   The method then iterates over each word `i` in the list `split` using a `for` loop.

5. **Prefix Comparison**:  
   Inside the loop, for each word `i`, the code checks if the string `searchWord` is a prefix of `i`:
   - `i[:len(searchWord)]` takes the first `len(searchWord)` characters of the word `i` and compares them with `searchWord`. 
   - If this substring is equal to `searchWord`, it means that `searchWord` is a prefix of the word `i`.

6. **Return Word Index**:  
   If `searchWord` is found as a prefix of word `i`, the method returns the index of the word (1-based). The word's index is found using `split.index(i) + 1`, as `split.index(i)` gives a 0-based index and we need to return a 1-based index.

7. **Early Exit**:  
   The `break` statement is unnecessary because the method already returns the result as soon as the prefix match is found. The loop will not continue after returning.

8. **Returning -1 if Not Found**:  
   If the loop completes and no match is found (i.e., `searchWord` is not a prefix of any word in `sentence`), the method returns `-1`.

9. **Time Complexity**:  
   - The time complexity is **O(n * m)**, where `n` is the number of words in the sentence, and `m` is the average length of the words. This is because for each word, we perform a substring comparison with `searchWord`.

10. **Space Complexity**:  
    The space complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of words in the sentence because the `.split()` method creates a list of words.

### Example:

Letâ€™s consider the following example:

```python
sentence = "i love programming in python"
searchWord = "pro"
```

#### Step-by-step Walkthrough:

1. The sentence is split into words:  
   `split = ["i", "love", "programming", "in", "python"]`.

2. The loop iterates over each word in the list `split`:
   - First, it checks the word `"i"`:
     - `i[:len(searchWord)] = "i"[:3]` which is `"i"`.
     - Since `"i"` is not equal to `"pro"`, the loop continues to the next word.
   - Next, it checks the word `"love"`:
     - `i[:len(searchWord)] = "love"[:3]` which is `"lov"`.
     - Since `"lov"` is not equal to `"pro"`, the loop continues.
   - Next, it checks the word `"programming"`:
     - `i[:len(searchWord)] = "programming"[:3]` which is `"pro"`.
     - Since `"pro" == "pro"`, the method returns the index of the word `"programming"` which is `3`.

Thus, the word `"programming"` (at index 3) has the prefix `"pro"`.

### Final Output:

```python
result = solution.isPrefixOfWord("i love programming in python", "pro")
print(result)  # Output: 3
```
