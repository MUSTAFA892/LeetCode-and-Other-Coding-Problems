## ðŸ”¹ Problem Restatement
We are given a list of points on the XY-plane.
We must find the **largest possible area** of any triangle formed by **choosing 3 points**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Code Walkthrough

```python
class Solution:
    def largestTriangleArea(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> float:
        max_area = 0
```

* `max_area` keeps track of the **largest triangle area found so far**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Triple nested loop

```python
for i in range(len(points)):
    for j in range(i+1, len(points)):
        for k in range(j+1, len(points)):
```

* Loops through **all possible combinations of 3 distinct points** (i, j, k).
* Since we need 3 points to form a triangle, we must check every triplet.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Shoelace formula for area

```python
area = 0.5 * abs(
    (points[i][0]*(points[j][1] - points[k][1])) +
    (points[j][0]*(points[k][1] - points[i][1])) +
    (points[k][0]*(points[i][1] - points[j][1]))
)
```

This is the **shoelace formula**, which calculates the area of a polygon (in this case, a triangle).

For three points ((x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2), (x_3,y_3)), the area is:

[
\text{Area} = \tfrac{1}{2} \cdot |x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2)|
]

Why? Itâ€™s derived from the determinant of the matrix representing the triangle.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Update maximum

```python
max_area = max(max_area, area)
```

* After computing area of this triangle, compare with current `max_area`.
* Keep the larger one.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Return

```python
return max_area
```

* At the end, we return the **largest area** found.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Working Example

### Example Input

```python
points = [[0,0], [0,1], [1,0], [0,2]]
```

---

### Step 1: Try triples

1. **(0,0), (0,1), (1,0)**

   * Plug into formula:
     [
     0.5 \times |0 \cdot (1-0) + 0 \cdot (0-0) + 1 \cdot (0-1)|
     = 0.5 \times |-1| = 0.5
     ]
     Area = 0.5

---

2. **(0,0), (0,1), (0,2)**

   * All x = 0 â†’ collinear â†’ area = 0

---

3. **(0,0), (0,1), (1,0)** already done

---

4. **(0,0), (1,0), (0,2)**

   * Formula:
     [
     0.5 \times |0 \cdot (0-2) + 1 \cdot (2-0) + 0 \cdot (0-0)|
     = 0.5 \times |2| = 1
     ]
     Area = 1

---

5. **(0,1), (1,0), (0,2)**

   * Formula:
     [
     0.5 \times |0 \cdot (0-2) + 1 \cdot (2-1) + 0 \cdot (1-0)|
     = 0.5 \times |1| = 0.5
     ]
     Area = 0.5

---

### Step 2: Compare

* Areas found = [0.5, 0, 1, 0.5]
* **Max = 1**

---

### Final Answer

```
1.0
```
