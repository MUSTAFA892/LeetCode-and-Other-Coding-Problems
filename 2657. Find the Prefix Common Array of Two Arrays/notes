1. **Class Definition**:
   - The solution is inside a class `Solution`, which is typical in coding challenges for organization. The function `findThePrefixCommonArray` is defined within this class.

2. **Function Signature**:
   - The function takes two arguments: `A` and `B`, which are both lists of integers.
   - It returns a list of integers (prefix common array) as per the problem's requirement.

3. **Initialization of `ans`**:
   - The variable `ans` is initialized as an empty list. This list will store the number of common elements between the prefixes of A and B at each index.

4. **Outer Loop (`for i in range(len(A))`)**:
   - The outer loop iterates through the elements of the arrays `A` and `B` by their indices (`i`).
   - At each iteration, it considers the prefixes of `A` and `B` up to index `i` (inclusive).

5. **Initialization of `count`**:
   - Inside the loop, the variable `count` is initialized to 0. This variable will be used to count the number of common elements between the prefixes of `A` and `B` at the current index `i`.

6. **Inner Loop (`for num in A[:i+1]`)**:
   - The inner loop iterates over the elements of the prefix of `A` (up to index `i`).
   - For each element `num` in the prefix of `A`, it checks whether `num` is present in the prefix of `B` (`B[:i+1]`).

7. **Checking for Common Elements**:
   - The condition `if num in B[:i+1]` checks if the current element of `A` is also present in the prefix of `B`. If so, it increments the `count`.

8. **Appending the Result**:
   - After processing each prefix (for each index `i`), the `count` (the number of common elements) is appended to the list `ans`.

9. **Returning the Final Answer**:
   - After all iterations, the function returns the list `ans`, which contains the count of common elements for each prefix of `A` and `B`.

10. **Time Complexity**:
   - The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2) because for each index `i`, you are slicing `A[:i+1]` and `B[:i+1]`, and checking for membership, which takes O(i) time. Hence, the overall complexity is O(n^2), where `n` is the length of the input arrays.

### Working Example:

Letâ€™s walk through an example to see how the code works step by step.

**Example Input**:
```python
A = [1, 3, 2, 4]
B = [3, 1, 2, 4]
```

### Iteration Breakdown:

1. **Index 0**:
   - Prefix of A: `[1]`
   - Prefix of B: `[3]`
   - No common elements between `[1]` and `[3]`.
   - **Result for index 0**: `0`
   - Append `0` to `ans`.

2. **Index 1**:
   - Prefix of A: `[1, 3]`
   - Prefix of B: `[3, 1]`
   - Common elements: `[1, 3]` (Both `1` and `3` are present in both prefixes).
   - **Result for index 1**: `2`
   - Append `2` to `ans`.

3. **Index 2**:
   - Prefix of A: `[1, 3, 2]`
   - Prefix of B: `[3, 1, 2]`
   - Common elements: `[1, 3, 2]` (All three elements are present in both prefixes).
   - **Result for index 2**: `3`
   - Append `3` to `ans`.

4. **Index 3**:
   - Prefix of A: `[1, 3, 2, 4]`
   - Prefix of B: `[3, 1, 2, 4]`
   - Common elements: `[1, 3, 2, 4]` (All four elements are present in both prefixes).
   - **Result for index 3**: `4`
   - Append `4` to `ans`.

### Final Answer:
The final result after processing all indices is:

```python
ans = [0, 2, 3, 4]
```
