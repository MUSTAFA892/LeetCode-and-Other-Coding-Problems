1. **Method Definition**:
   - The method `isPowerOfTwo` is defined inside the `Solution` class and takes an integer `n` as an argument.
   - It returns `True` if `n` is a power of two, and `False` otherwise.

2. **Range of Exponent**:
   - The `for` loop iterates over the range `31`, which means the exponent `i` will take values from `0` to `30`. This is because `2^30` is the largest power of two that fits within a standard 32-bit signed integer range.

3. **Powers of Two Calculation**:
   - In each iteration, the code calculates `2^i` using Python's exponentiation operator `**`.
   - For example, when `i = 0`, it calculates `2^0 = 1`; when `i = 1`, it calculates `2^1 = 2`; and so on.

4. **Comparing with `n`**:
   - After calculating `2^i`, the code checks if the result equals `n` (`if ans == n`).
   - If the current power of two equals `n`, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a power of two.

5. **Exiting Early**:
   - As soon as a match is found (i.e., `ans == n`), the loop terminates, and the function immediately returns `True`. This ensures efficiency in case the answer is found early.

6. **Loop Termination**:
   - If no power of two matches `n` after checking all powers from `2^0` to `2^30`, the loop will finish, and the function will return `False`, indicating that `n` is not a power of two.

7. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The code doesn't explicitly check for negative numbers or zero, but since all powers of two are positive integers, it will never match these cases.
   - The check is based on whether `n` matches any power of two, and negative numbers and zero will never match.

8. **Computational Efficiency**:
   - The loop runs at most 31 iterations, which is constant time (`O(1)`), because we know the number of iterations is fixed and does not depend on the value of `n`.

9. **Space Complexity**:
   - The space complexity of the algorithm is `O(1)` because the only additional memory used is for the variable `ans`, which stores the result of `2^i` for each iteration.

10. **Limitations**:
   - The method is somewhat inefficient compared to other approaches like bitwise operations because it performs exponentiation and comparisons in a loop. For larger inputs, the alternative methods (like bitwise operations) can be more efficient.

### Working Example:

Letâ€™s go through the function with an example to see how it works.

#### Example 1:
**Input**: `n = 8`

- **Step 1**: The function starts with `i = 0`. It calculates `2^0 = 1`. This is not equal to `n` (which is `8`), so it moves to the next iteration.
- **Step 2**: The function calculates `2^1 = 2`. This is still not equal to `n`, so it continues.
- **Step 3**: The function calculates `2^2 = 4`. This is not equal to `n`, so it moves on.
- **Step 4**: The function calculates `2^3 = 8`. This is equal to `n`, so the function returns `True`.

#### Output:
```python
True
```

#### Example 2:
**Input**: `n = 6`

- **Step 1**: The function starts with `i = 0`. It calculates `2^0 = 1`. This is not equal to `n` (which is `6`), so it moves to the next iteration.
- **Step 2**: The function calculates `2^1 = 2`. This is still not equal to `n`, so it continues.
- **Step 3**: The function calculates `2^2 = 4`. This is not equal to `n`, so it moves on.
- **Step 4**: The function calculates `2^3 = 8`. This is still not equal to `n`, and at this point, the loop reaches `i = 30` without finding a match. Therefore, the function returns `False`.

#### Output:
```python
False
```
