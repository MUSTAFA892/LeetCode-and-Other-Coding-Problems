### ✅ Problem Summary

* You are given a **word** (a string).
* You must check if the word is **valid** based on these rules:

  1. The word must be **at least 3 characters long**
  2. It should only contain **letters and digits** (no special characters like `@`, `!`, `#`)
  3. It must have **at least one vowel** (`a, e, i, o, u`)
  4. It must have **at least one consonant**

---

## 💡 Intuition (Key Idea)

* A valid word should be **clean (alphanumeric)** and have a **mix of vowels and consonants**.
* Special characters make it invalid.
* We don’t care about digits unless a special symbol is present — in which case, it's invalid.

---

## 🧠 Example 1: `"abc"`

* Length = 3 ✅
* Characters = all letters ✅
* Vowel = `'a'` ✅
* Consonants = `'b'`, `'c'` ✅
* No special characters ✅

🔹 **Result: Valid (True)**

---

## ❌ Example 2: `"a1!"`

* Length = 3 ✅
* Contains a special character `!` ❌
* So, it's **invalid** even though it has a vowel and a digit.

🔹 **Result: Invalid (False)**

---

## ❌ Example 3: `"aei"`

* All characters are vowels ✅
* No consonants ❌
* So, it's **invalid**

🔹 **Result: Invalid (False)**

---

## ✅ Example 4: `"b2e"`

* Length = 3 ✅
* Contains only alphanumeric characters ✅
* Contains vowel `e` ✅
* Contains consonant `b` ✅

🔹 **Result: Valid (True)**
