### 1. **Loop Through the List**
   - The solution uses a `for` loop to iterate through the list `nums` and find the indices where `target` appears.
   
   **Example:**
   ```python
   nums = [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10]
   target = 8
   ```
   During the loop, the indices of `target = 8` will be found at `3` and `4`.

### 2. **Checking for Target in List**
   - In each iteration of the loop, we compare the current element (`nums[i]`) with the `target`. If they match, the index is appended to the `result` list.
   
   **Example:**
   - At `i=3`, `nums[3] = 8` matches `target = 8`, so `3` is added to `result`.
   - At `i=4`, `nums[4] = 8` matches again, so `4` is added.

### 3. **Result List** 
   - The `result` list stores all indices where the target is found.
   
   **Example:**
   - After the loop finishes, `result = [3, 4]` because `target = 8` is found at indices 3 and 4.

### 4. **Handling Empty Result (Target Not Found)**
   - If `result` is empty, meaning the `target` is not found in the list, the function returns `[-1, -1]`.
   
   **Example:**
   ```python
   nums = [1, 2, 3]
   target = 4
   ```
   - `result = []` because `4` is not found in `nums`. So the function will return `[-1, -1]`.

### 5. **Return First and Last Occurrence**
   - After the loop, if the target is found, the function returns the first and last index where the target occurs.
   - This is done using `result[0]` for the first index and `result[-1]` for the last index.
   
   **Example:**
   ```python
   nums = [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10]
   target = 8
   ```
   - `result = [3, 4]`, so the function returns `[3, 4]` as the first and last occurrence of `8`.

### 6. **Checking List Length of `result`**
   - By checking whether `result` is empty, the function determines whether the target exists in the list.
   
   **Example:**
   ```python
   nums = [1, 3, 5]
   target = 2
   ```
   - Since `result = []`, the function will return `[-1, -1]`.

### 7. **Efficient Handling of Multiple Occurrences**
   - The `result` list collects all indices where the `target` appears, so the solution handles cases where the target appears multiple times.

   **Example:**
   ```python
   nums = [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10]
   target = 7
   ```
   - `result = [1, 2]`, and the function will return `[1, 2]` as the first and last occurrence.

### 8. **Space Complexity** 
   - The space complexity is O(n) in the worst case, where `n` is the number of occurrences of the `target` in the list.
   - If the target appears every time, the `result` will store all the indices.

   **Example:**
   ```python
   nums = [7, 7, 7, 7]
   target = 7
   ```
   - `result = [0, 1, 2, 3]`, so the function will return `[0, 3]`.

### 9. **Time Complexity**
   - The time complexity is O(n) because the list is iterated through once to find the target, where `n` is the length of the list `nums`.
   
   **Example:**
   ```python
   nums = [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10]
   target = 8
   ```
   - The loop runs `n = 6` times to find the target, and the total time complexity is O(6).

### 10. **Handles Edge Cases**
   - The code is robust against edge cases like:
     - An empty list (`nums = []`).
     - The target appearing once.
     - The target not being in the list.
     - The target appearing multiple times.
   
   **Examples:**
   - Empty list: `nums = []`, `target = 3` → `[-1, -1]`.
   - Single element list: `nums = [1]`, `target = 1` → `[0, 0]`.

### Full Example Test Cases
1. **Target found multiple times**:
   ```python
   nums = [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10]
   target = 8
   ```
   **Output**: `[3, 4]`

2. **Target not found**:
   ```python
   nums = [1, 2, 3]
   target = 4
   ```
   **Output**: `[-1, -1]`

3. **Target found once**:
   ```python
   nums = [1]
   target = 1
   ```
   **Output**: `[0, 0]`

4. **Empty list**:
   ```python
   nums = []
   target = 0
   ```
   **Output**: `[-1, -1]`

5. **Target found at first and last position**:
   ```python
   nums = [7, 7, 7, 7]
   target = 7
   ```
   **Output**: `[0, 3]`
