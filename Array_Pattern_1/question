## ❓ Question: Spiral Matrix Traversal

Given a 2D matrix of size `m × n`, print all the elements of the matrix in **spiral order**, starting from the **top-left corner** and moving in a **clockwise direction**.

### 📌 Explanation (Problem Description)

* Start from the **top-left element**
* Traverse:

  1. Left to Right (top row)
  2. Top to Bottom (right column)
  3. Right to Left (bottom row)
  4. Bottom to Top (left column)
* Repeat the process for inner layers until all elements are printed

---

### 🧠 Constraints

* Do not print any element more than once
* Use boundary pointers to avoid revisiting elements
* Matrix may be **rectangular**, not necessarily square

---

### ⏱️ Expected Complexity

* **Time Complexity:** `O(m × n)`
* **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`
