## 🔎 Explanation of your code

You’re checking **isomorphism** by maintaining two maps:

* `map_s`: maps each character from `s → t`
* `map_t`: maps each character from `t → s`

Then, for every character pair `(i, j)` from `s` and `t` (looping together):

1. **Insert mapping if missing**

   ```python
   if i not in map_s:---

👉 So your code now correctly checks **order + one-to-one mapping** instead of just frequencies.

Do you want me to also dry-run it on your tricky case (`s = "bbbaaaba"`, `t = "aaabbbba"`) so you can see why it fails there (as it should)?

       map_s[i] = j
   if j not in map_t:
       map_t[j] = i
   ```

   * If a character hasn’t been mapped yet, create the mapping.
   * This builds the one-to-one relationship.

2. **Check consistency**

   ```python
   if map_s[i] != j or map_t[j] != i:
       return False
   ```

   * If `s[i]` doesn’t map to `t[i]`, or `t[i]` doesn’t map back to `s[i]`, → return `False`.
   * This ensures **consistency** and prevents two different characters mapping to the same one.

3. If the loop finishes with no conflicts → return `True`.

## ✅ Working Example

`s = "egg"`, `t = "add"`

Step by step:

* Pair 1: `e → a`

  * `map_s = {e: a}`, `map_t = {a: e}`
  * Consistent ✅

* Pair 2: `g → d`

  * `map_s = {e: a, g: d}`, `map_t = {a: e, d: g}`
  * Consistent ✅

* Pair 3: `g → d` again

  * Already mapped, and consistent ✅

Loop ends → return `True`.

## ❌ Non-working Example

`s = "foo"`, `t = "bar"`

* Pair 1: `f → b`

  * `map_s = {f: b}`, `map_t = {b: f}`
* Pair 2: `o → a`

  * `map_s = {f: b, o: a}`, `map_t = {b: f, a: o}`
* Pair 3: `o → r`

  * But `map_s[o] = a` ≠ `r` → conflict ❌

Return `False`.
