# ✅ Approach 1 — Using Dictionary

### ✔ Code

```python
class Solution:
    def repeatedNTimes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        freq = {}
        
        for i in nums:
            if i in freq:
                return i

            freq[i] = 1
```

## 🔍 Explanation (Simple)

* Create an empty dictionary `freq`
* Loop through each number `i` in `nums`
* If the number already exists in the dictionary →
  That means we’ve seen it before → return it
* Otherwise, store it in the dictionary

### 🚀 Key Idea

> The first number that appears **twice** must be the repeated element.

Because the repeated element appears many times — you will hit it twice very early.

## 🧪 Working Example (Step-by-Step)

### Input

```
nums = [9, 3, 9, 2, 6, 9]
```

### Trace Table

| Step | i (current value) | freq dictionary | Action                    | Return |
| ---: | ----------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- | ------ |
|    1 | 9                 | {}              | add 9                     | —      |
|    2 | 3                 | {9:1}           | add 3                     | —      |
|    3 | 9                 | {9:1, 3:1}      | 9 already exists → return | **9**  |

### Output

```
9
```

# ✅ Approach 2 — Using Counter

### ✔ Code

```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def repeatedNTimes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        freq = Counter(nums)
        return freq.most_common()[0][0]
```

## 🔍 Explanation

### What is `Counter`?

It automatically counts occurrences of elements.

Example

```
Counter([1,2,3,3])
→ {1:1, 2:1, 3:2}
```

### What is `most_common()`?

```
freq.most_common()[0]
```

returns

```
(element, count)
```

So:

```
freq.most_common()[0][0]
→ element itself
```

---

## 🧪 Working Example (Step-by-Step)

### Input

```
nums = [2,1,2,5,3,2]
```

### Frequency Count

```
Counter(nums)
= {2:3, 1:1, 5:1, 3:1}
```

### most_common

```
freq.most_common()
= [(2,3), (1,1), (5,1), (3,1)]
```

First element:

```
freq.most_common()[0][0]
= 2
```

### Output

```
2
```
