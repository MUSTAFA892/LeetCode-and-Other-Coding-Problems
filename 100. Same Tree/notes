### 1. **Recursive Approach**
   - **Explanation**: The solution uses a **recursive approach** to traverse both trees in parallel. For each pair of nodes, it checks whether they are equal, and recursively checks their left and right children.
   - **Why it's important**: Recursion is a natural fit for tree-related problems because trees have a hierarchical structure, and recursion allows you to simplify the problem by solving smaller subproblems.

### 2. **Base Case 1: Both Nodes are None**
   - **Code**: `if p is None and q is None: return True`
   - **Explanation**: If both nodes are `None`, it means both trees (or subtrees) are empty at this point, and thus they are considered identical.
   - **Why it's important**: This is the base case for the recursion. When both nodes are `None`, the trees are equal, so you return `True`.

### 3. **Base Case 2: One Node is None and the Other is Not**
   - **Code**: `if p is None or q is None: return False`
   - **Explanation**: If one tree has a node and the other is `None`, the trees are not the same because they have different structures. In this case, the function immediately returns `False`.
   - **Why it's important**: This ensures that if one tree ends earlier than the other (one node is `None`), the trees are considered different.

### 4. **Checking Node Values**
   - **Code**: `if p.val == q.val:`
   - **Explanation**: If both nodes are not `None`, the function compares their values. If they are not equal, the trees are not the same, and the function should return `False`.
   - **Why it's important**: This step ensures that the values at corresponding nodes are equal. If the values differ, the trees are definitely not the same.

### 5. **Recursive Calls for Left Subtrees**
   - **Code**: `return self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left) and self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right)`
   - **Explanation**: If the values of the nodes are the same, the function recursively checks the left and right subtrees of both trees. This ensures the entire structure of the trees is the same.
   - **Why it's important**: This step is crucial because it checks the structural similarity of the trees. If the left and right subtrees of the trees differ, the trees are not identical.

### 6. **Early Termination on Inequality**
   - **Code**: `return False` (after `if p.val != q.val`)
   - **Explanation**: If the values of `p` and `q` at any node are not the same, the function immediately returns `False`, signaling that the trees are different.
   - **Why it's important**: This early exit mechanism improves efficiency by stopping the comparison as soon as a mismatch is found, preventing unnecessary recursive calls.

### 7. **Handling Edge Cases for Empty Trees**
   - **Explanation**: The function correctly handles cases where one or both trees are empty by checking `None` values explicitly.
   - **Why it's important**: These checks are critical because empty trees are a special case. The logic ensures that two empty trees are considered the same, while a non-empty tree and an empty tree are considered different.

### 8. **Symmetry in Recursive Calls**
   - **Code**: `self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left)` and `self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right)`
   - **Explanation**: The recursion is symmetrical for both the left and right children of the current nodes. It ensures that both sides of the tree are checked independently but similarly.
   - **Why it's important**: This symmetry ensures the correctness of the solution, ensuring both trees have identical structures and values, not just one side.

### 9. **Time Complexity: O(n)**
   - **Explanation**: The time complexity of the function is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the trees. This is because, in the worst case, the function will visit every node once (each node is compared).
   - **Why it's important**: The linear time complexity makes the algorithm efficient, as it processes each node only once.

Let's walk through the **`isSameTree`** function with a working example to understand how it works step by step.

### Example:
We have two binary trees `p` and `q`:

#### Tree `p`:
```
    1
   / \
  2   3
 /  
4    
```

#### Tree `q`:
```
    1
   / \
  2   3
 /  
4    
```

Notice that both trees are identical. Let's go through how the `isSameTree` function will check whether they are the same.

### Step-by-Step Execution:

1. **First Call (Root Node)**:
   - The function is called with `p = TreeNode(1)` and `q = TreeNode(1)`.
   - `p` and `q` are not `None`, so we proceed to compare their values.
   - `p.val == q.val` → `1 == 1`, which is true. So, we continue checking their left and right subtrees.

2. **Second Call (Left Subtrees of Root)**:
   - Now, we recursively call `isSameTree(p.left, q.left)` with `p = TreeNode(2)` and `q = TreeNode(2)`.
   - `p` and `q` are not `None`, and `p.val == q.val` → `2 == 2`, which is true. So, we proceed to check their left and right subtrees.

3. **Third Call (Left Subtrees of Node 2)**:
   - Now, we recursively call `isSameTree(p.left, q.left)` with `p = TreeNode(4)` and `q = TreeNode(4)`.
   - `p` and `q` are not `None`, and `p.val == q.val` → `4 == 4`, which is true. We now proceed to check their left and right subtrees.
   
4. **Fourth Call (Left Subtree of Node 4)**:
   - We now recursively call `isSameTree(p.left, q.left)` with `p = None` and `q = None` (since both `p.left` and `q.left` are `None`).
   - Since both are `None`, we return `True` for this call.

5. **Fifth Call (Right Subtree of Node 4)**:
   - We now recursively call `isSameTree(p.right, q.right)` with `p = None` and `q = None` (since both `p.right` and `q.right` are `None`).
   - Since both are `None`, we return `True` for this call.

6. **Return to Node 2**:
   - At this point, both the left and right subtrees of `Node 4` have been confirmed to be the same.
   - So, we return `True` for `isSameTree(p.left, q.left)` at `Node 2`.

7. **Sixth Call (Right Subtrees of Node 2)**:
   - We now recursively call `isSameTree(p.right, q.right)` with `p = None` and `q = None` (since both `p.right` and `q.right` are `None`).
   - Since both are `None`, we return `True` for this call.

8. **Return to Root Node**:
   - Now, we have confirmed that the left subtree of `Node 1` is the same in both `p` and `q`.
   - We now return to check the right subtrees of the root.

9. **Seventh Call (Right Subtrees of Root)**:
   - We now recursively call `isSameTree(p.right, q.right)` with `p = TreeNode(3)` and `q = TreeNode(3)`.
   - `p` and `q` are not `None`, and `p.val == q.val` → `3 == 3`, which is true. We now proceed to check their left and right subtrees.

10. **Eighth Call (Left Subtrees of Node 3)**:
    - We recursively call `isSameTree(p.left, q.left)` with `p = None` and `q = None` (since both `p.left` and `q.left` are `None`).
    - Since both are `None`, we return `True` for this call.

11. **Ninth Call (Right Subtrees of Node 3)**:
    - We recursively call `isSameTree(p.right, q.right)` with `p = None` and `q = None` (since both `p.right` and `q.right` are `None`).
    - Since both are `None`, we return `True` for this call.

12. **Final Check**:
    - Now, we have confirmed that the left and right subtrees of `Node 3` are the same in both `p` and `q`.
    - So, we return `True` for `isSameTree(p.right, q.right)` at `Node 1`.

13. **Return the Final Result**:
    - Since all recursive calls have returned `True` for the left and right subtrees of every node, the final result returned by the function is `True`.

### Final Output:
The function returns `True` because the two trees `p` and `q` are identical.
