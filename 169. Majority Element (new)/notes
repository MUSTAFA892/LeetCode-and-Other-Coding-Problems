## ðŸ”¹ Approach 1: Sorting Method

The function `majorityElement` identifies the majority element by **sorting the input list** and returning the middle element. This method is based on the mathematical guarantee that a number appearing more than `n/2` times will always end up at the middle index of the sorted list.

---

### How the Code Works:

1. **Sort the List**:
   - The input list `nums` is sorted. This groups identical elements together and orders them.

2. **Identify Majority Position**:
   - Since the majority element appears more than half the time, it **must** occupy the middle index of the sorted list.

3. **Access Middle Element**:
   - The function directly returns `nums[len(nums)//2]`.

4. **No Need for Extra Storage**:
   - No additional data structures are used; only sorting and indexing.

5. **Time Complexity**:
   - Sorting takes `O(n log n)` time.

6. **Space Complexity**:
   - If sorting is in-place, the space complexity is `O(1)` (excluding input).

7. **Clean and Simple**:
   - Minimal lines of code â€” easy to understand and implement.

8. **Assumes Majority Exists**:
   - The method works only if a majority element is guaranteed.

9. **Fails in Edge Cases**:
   - If no majority element exists, this method may still return an incorrect result (e.g., an element at the middle thatâ€™s not the majority).

10. **Efficient for Guaranteed Cases**:
   - Great choice when the input follows the problem constraint (majority always exists).

### âœ… Example:

#### Input:
```
nums = [2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4]
```

#### Execution:

1. **Sort**:
   - `[1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4]`

2. **Length**:  
   - `n = 7`, so `n // 2 = 3`

3. **Middle Element**:
   - Index 3 â†’ `1`

#### Output:
```
1
```

## ðŸ”¹ Approach 2: Hashmap (Frequency Count) Method

This version of the function uses a **hashmap** (or dictionary) to count how many times each element appears. It then returns the element with the **highest frequency**, assuming it appears more than `n/2` times.

---

### How the Code Works:

1. **Import Counter**:
   - Uses Pythonâ€™s `collections.Counter` to count occurrences of each element in `nums`.

2. **Build Frequency Map**:
   - Each unique number is stored with its count: `{number: count}`.

3. **Track Maximum**:
   - Iterate through the frequency map to find the element with the **highest count**.

4. **Return Most Frequent**:
   - Return the element that appears most â€” which, under the problem constraint, will be the majority element.

5. **Time Complexity**:
   - Counting frequencies and iterating both take `O(n)` time.

6. **Space Complexity**:
   - Uses `O(n)` space to store the frequency map.

7. **Explicit and Reliable**:
   - Very clear and safe â€” especially when the majority is not guaranteed, as it can be adjusted to validate the count.

8. **Verbose but Transparent**:
   - Slightly more code than sorting, but offers full control and visibility.

9. **Good for Any Case**:
   - Can be adapted to check if any number exceeds `n // 2`, making it safer for generalized use.

10. **Easy to Extend**:
   - You can easily modify this method to return all elements above a certain frequency, not just the majority.

### âœ… Example:

#### Input:
```
nums = [2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4]
```

#### Execution:

1. **Count Frequencies**:
   - `{1: 4, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1}`

2. **Find Max Count**:
   - `1` appears `4` times

3. **Check Condition**:
   - `4 > len(nums)//2 = 3` â†’ âœ…

#### Output:
```
1
```
