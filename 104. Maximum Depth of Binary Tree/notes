#### Code Explanation

```python
class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
```
This is the main class `Solution` that contains the method `maxDepth`. The method takes a single argument `root`, which is the root of the binary tree (a `TreeNode` object or `None`).

```python
        def is_level(node):
            if node is None:
                return 0  # Base case: depth of None is 0
```
This is a helper function `is_level`, which calculates the depth of a given node. It starts by checking if the node is `None`. If it is `None`, this means we've reached the end of a branch (or the tree is empty), so it returns `0`, which represents the depth of an empty tree or subtree.

```python
            left_depth = is_level(node.left)
            right_depth = is_level(node.right)
```
Now, if the node is not `None`, the function recursively calculates the depth of the left and right subtrees by calling `is_level` on the left and right child nodes (`node.left` and `node.right`). This is the key part of the recursion.

```python
            return max(left_depth, right_depth) + 1
```
The depth of the current node is 1 plus the maximum depth of its left and right subtrees. The `max(left_depth, right_depth)` part ensures that we are considering the longest path from this node to a leaf. Adding `1` accounts for the current node itself.

```python
        return is_level(root)
```
Finally, the `maxDepth` function returns the result of `is_level(root)`, which gives the maximum depth of the binary tree starting from the root.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's work through an example with the following binary tree:

```
       1
     /   \
    2     3
   / \     \
  4   5     6
```

- **Step 1**: Call `maxDepth(root)` where `root` is the node with value `1`.

```python
maxDepth(root)
```
This calls `is_level(root)` with the root node (value `1`).

---

#### Inside `is_level(root)` (node 1):

```python
is_level(1)
```

- `node` is `1`, so it is not `None`.
- We then recursively call `is_level` on the left and right children of node `1` (nodes `2` and `3`).

```python
left_depth = is_level(node.left)  # is_level(2)
right_depth = is_level(node.right)  # is_level(3)
```

---

#### Inside `is_level(2)` (left child of node 1):

```python
is_level(2)
```

- `node` is `2`, so it is not `None`.
- We recursively call `is_level` on the left and right children of node `2` (nodes `4` and `5`).

```python
left_depth = is_level(node.left)  # is_level(4)
right_depth = is_level(node.right)  # is_level(5)
```

---

##### Inside `is_level(4)` (left child of node 2):

```python
is_level(4)
```

- `node` is `4`, so it is not `None`.
- `node.left` and `node.right` are both `None` (leaf node), so we return `0` for both.
- The depth of node `4` is `max(0, 0) + 1 = 1`.

```python
return 1  # Depth of node 4 is 1
```

---

##### Inside `is_level(5)` (right child of node 2):

```python
is_level(5)
```

- `node` is `5`, so it is not `None`.
- `node.left` and `node.right` are both `None` (leaf node), so we return `0` for both.
- The depth of node `5` is `max(0, 0) + 1 = 1`.

```python
return 1  # Depth of node 5 is 1
```

---

#### Back to `is_level(2)`:

Now, with the depths of the left and right children of node `2` calculated (both `1`), we compute the depth of node `2`:

```python
return max(1, 1) + 1 = 2  # Depth of node 2 is 2
```

---

#### Inside `is_level(3)` (right child of node 1):

```python
is_level(3)
```

- `node` is `3`, so it is not `None`.
- We recursively call `is_level` on the left and right children of node `3`. `node.left` is `None`, and `node.right` is `6`.

```python
left_depth = is_level(node.left)  # is_level(None)
right_depth = is_level(node.right)  # is_level(6)
```

---

##### Inside `is_level(None)` (left child of node 3):

```python
is_level(None)
```

- Since the node is `None`, we return `0`.

```python
return 0  # Depth of None is 0
```

---

##### Inside `is_level(6)` (right child of node 3):

```python
is_level(6)
```

- `node` is `6`, so it is not `None`.
- `node.left` and `node.right` are both `None` (leaf node), so we return `0` for both.
- The depth of node `6` is `max(0, 0) + 1 = 1`.

```python
return 1  # Depth of node 6 is 1
```

---

#### Back to `is_level(3)`:

Now, with the depths of the left and right children of node `3` calculated (`0` and `1`), we compute the depth of node `3`:

```python
return max(0, 1) + 1 = 2  # Depth of node 3 is 2
```

---

#### Back to `is_level(1)`:

Finally, with the depths of the left and right children of node `1` calculated (`2` and `2`), we compute the depth of node `1`:

```python
return max(2, 2) + 1 = 3  # Depth of node 1 is 3
```

---

### Final Result

The maximum depth of the tree is `3`, which is the correct result for this tree.
