1. **Function Purpose**:
   The function checks whether there are two distinct indices `i` and `j` in the array `nums` such that:
   - `nums[i] == nums[j]`
   - The absolute difference of indices `i` and `j` is less than or equal to a given value `k`.

2. **Input Parameters**:
   - `nums`: A list of integers.
   - `k`: An integer that represents the maximum allowed index distance between duplicate values.

3. **Data Structure Used**:
   - A dictionary `freq` is used to store the most recent index of each element encountered in the array.
   
4. **Efficient Lookups**:
   - The dictionary allows constant time (`O(1)`) lookups and insertions, making the solution efficient.

5. **First Check**:
   - If an element is already present in `freq`, the function checks whether the difference between the current index `i` and the stored index of that element is less than or equal to `k`.

6. **Return True Immediately**:
   - If a valid pair of indices is found (i.e., the element appears again within a range of `k`), the function immediately returns `True`.

7. **Storing Indices**:
   - If the element has not appeared before, its current index is stored in `freq`.

8. **Break After Return**:
   - The `break` statement after `return True` is redundant because the function already returns at that point. The `break` is not needed for correctness.

9. **Final Check**:
   - If the loop completes without finding any valid duplicate pair within the distance `k`, the function returns `False`.

10. **Time and Space Complexity**:
   - **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where `n` is the length of `nums` because we are iterating over the list once and performing constant-time operations (insert and lookup) on the dictionary.
   - **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) due to the space required to store the indices in the dictionary.

### Working Example:

Let's work through an example with the input:

#### Example Input:
```python
nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]
k = 3
```

#### Code Execution Walkthrough:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - `freq = {}` (empty dictionary to store indices)

2. **First iteration** (i = 0):
   - `nums[0] = 1`
   - `1` is not in `freq`, so we add it: `freq = {1: 0}` (element `1` at index `0`).

3. **Second iteration** (i = 1):
   - `nums[1] = 2`
   - `2` is not in `freq`, so we add it: `freq = {1: 0, 2: 1}` (element `2` at index `1`).

4. **Third iteration** (i = 2):
   - `nums[2] = 3`
   - `3` is not in `freq`, so we add it: `freq = {1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 2}` (element `3` at index `2`).

5. **Fourth iteration** (i = 3):
   - `nums[3] = 1`
   - `1` is already in `freq` (its previous index is `0`).
   - Check the difference: \( \left| 3 - 0 \right| = 3 \).
   - Since \( 3 \leq 3 \), we return `True`.

#### Output:
```python
True
```
