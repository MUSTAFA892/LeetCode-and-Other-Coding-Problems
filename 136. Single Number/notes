1. **Function Definition**:
   - The method `singleNumber` is defined inside the `Solution` class and takes a list `nums` as input.
   - The return type is `int`, as it returns the unique number that appears once in the list.

2. **Input**:
   - The input is a list of integers `nums` where all numbers except one appear twice, and one number appears once.

3. **Use of `set(nums)`**:
   - `set(nums)` converts the list `nums` into a set, which removes all duplicate numbers.
   - If the list has duplicates, the set will only keep one instance of each unique number.

4. **Summing the Set**:
   - `sum(set(nums))` calculates the sum of all unique numbers in the set.
   - This sum will be the sum of all distinct elements in the original list, with duplicates removed.

5. **Double the Sum of Unique Numbers**:
   - `2 * sum(set(nums))` computes the sum of all unique numbers **doubled**.
   - In the case where every number appears twice, this doubles the total sum of the numbers, because each number will be counted twice when the list is reformed from the set.

6. **Original Sum**:
   - `sum(nums)` computes the sum of all numbers in the original list, including duplicates.

7. **Mathematical Insight**:
   - When you subtract `sum(nums)` from `2 * sum(set(nums))`, the effect is that:
     - The duplicate numbers (which appear twice) will cancel each other out, leaving only the single number that appears once.

8. **Why This Works**:
   - If the array contains numbers `a, a, b, b, c`, where `c` is the single number that appears once, then:
     - `sum(set(nums)) = a + b + c`
     - `sum(nums) = 2a + 2b + c`
     - So, `2 * sum(set(nums)) = 2a + 2b + 2c` and subtracting `sum(nums)` gives:
       - `(2a + 2b + 2c) - (2a + 2b + c) = c`, the unique number.

9. **Efficiency**:
   - The time complexity of this approach is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`, because:
     - Creating a set from the list takes O(n).
     - Summing the set and the list both take O(n).
   - The space complexity is **O(n)**, due to the space required for storing the set of unique numbers.

10. **Edge Case**:
   - The function works even if the input list has only one element because `set(nums)` will just be that one element, and `sum(nums)` will also be the same, resulting in the correct output.

### Working Example:

#### Example 1:
```python
nums = [4, 1, 2, 1, 2]
sol = Solution()
print(sol.singleNumber(nums))  # Output: 4
```

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Input List**: `nums = [4, 1, 2, 1, 2]`
   
2. **Step 1: Convert List to Set**:
   - `set(nums)` → `{1, 2, 4}` (Duplicates are removed).

3. **Step 2: Sum of Unique Elements**:
   - `sum(set(nums)) = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7`

4. **Step 3: Sum of All Elements in the List**:
   - `sum(nums) = 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 10`

5. **Step 4: Apply Formula**:
   - `2 * sum(set(nums)) = 2 * 7 = 14`
   - `sum(nums) = 10`
   - `2 * sum(set(nums)) - sum(nums) = 14 - 10 = 4`

6. **Result**: The unique number is `4`.

#### Output:
```
4
```

#### Example 2:
```python
nums = [2, 2, 3]
sol = Solution()
print(sol.singleNumber(nums))  # Output: 3
```

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Input List**: `nums = [2, 2, 3]`
   
2. **Step 1: Convert List to Set**:
   - `set(nums)` → `{2, 3}` (Duplicates are removed).

3. **Step 2: Sum of Unique Elements**:
   - `sum(set(nums)) = 2 + 3 = 5`

4. **Step 3: Sum of All Elements in the List**:
   - `sum(nums) = 2 + 2 + 3 = 7`

5. **Step 4: Apply Formula**:
   - `2 * sum(set(nums)) = 2 * 5 = 10`
   - `sum(nums) = 7`
   - `2 * sum(set(nums)) - sum(nums) = 10 - 7 = 3`

6. **Result**: The unique number is `3`.

#### Output:
```
3
```
