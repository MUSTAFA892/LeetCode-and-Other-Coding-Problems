## 🔹 Problem Recap

**Goal:**

* Given an array `nums` and an integer `k`, you can **increment elements by 1 at most k times**.
* Find the **maximum frequency of any number** after at most `k` increments.

**Example:**

```
nums = [3,1,4,1,5], k = 5
```

---

## 🔹 Step 1: Sort the array

```python
nums.sort()
```

* Sorted array = `[1,1,3,4,5]`
* **Why?**

  * The algorithm uses a **sliding window** where we make **all elements in the window equal to the largest element (`nums[right]`)**.
  * Sorting ensures the **largest element in any window is always at the right**.

---

## 🔹 Step 2: Initialize variables

```python
left = 0         # start of the sliding window
total = 0        # sum of elements in the current window
max_freq = 0     # maximum frequency found so far
```

* **Window** = `nums[left:right]`
* **Total** = sum of elements in the current window
* **max_freq** = result we will return

---

## 🔹 Step 3: Loop through the array (expand the window)

```python
for right in range(len(nums)):
    total += nums[right]
```

* Expand the window to include `nums[right]`
* Update `total` with the new element

---

## 🔹 Step 4: Calculate operations needed

```python
ops = (nums[right] * (right - left + 1)) - total
```

* **Idea:** Make **all elements in the window equal to `nums[right]`**.
* Formula explained:

```
operations_needed = (largest_element * window_size) - sum(window_elements)
```

* `window_size = right - left + 1`
* `largest_element = nums[right]`
* `sum(window_elements = total)`

✅ This gives the **number of increments needed** to make all elements in the window equal.

---

## 🔹 Step 5: Shrink window if needed

```python
if ops > k:
    total -= nums[left]
    left += 1
```

* If `ops > k`, we **cannot make all numbers equal** in this window with available operations.
* Shrink the window from the left until it becomes valid:

  * Remove `nums[left]` from `total`
  * Move `left` pointer right

---

## 🔹 Step 6: Update maximum frequency

```python
max_freq = max(max_freq, right - left + 1)
```

* Window size = number of elements we can make equal with ≤ k operations
* Update `max_freq` if this window is larger than previous

---

## 🔹 Step 7: Return result

```python
return max_freq
```

* After going through the array, `max_freq` is the **largest number of elements that can be made equal**.

---

## 🔹 Working Example (Step by Step)

```
nums = [3,1,4,1,5], k = 5
```

1. Sort → `[1,1,3,4,5]`
2. Initialize → `left=0`, `total=0`, `max_freq=0`

---

### Iteration 1: right=0

* Window = `[1]`
* total = 1
* ops = 1*1 - 1 = 0 ≤ 5 ✅
* max_freq = 1

---

### Iteration 2: right=1

* Window = `[1,1]`
* total = 1+1=2
* ops = 1*2 - 2 = 0 ≤ 5 ✅
* max_freq = 2

---

### Iteration 3: right=2

* Window = `[1,1,3]`
* total = 2+3=5
* ops = 3*3 - 5 = 9-5 = 4 ≤ 5 ✅
* max_freq = 3

---

### Iteration 4: right=3

* Window = `[1,1,3,4]`
* total = 5+4=9
* ops = 4*4 - 9 = 16-9 = 7 > 5 ❌ → shrink window

  * Remove left=0 element: total -=1 → total=8, left=1
* Window now `[1,3,4]`
* ops = 4*3 - 8 = 12-8=4 ≤5 ✅
* max_freq = max(3,3)=3

---

### Iteration 5: right=4

* Window = `[1,3,4,5]`
* total = 8+5=13
* ops = 5*4 - 13 = 20-13=7 >5 ❌ → shrink left

  * Remove left=1 element: total -=1 → total=12, left=2
* Window `[3,4,5]`
* ops = 5*3 - 12 = 15-12=3 ≤5 ✅
* max_freq = max(3,3)=3

---

### ✅ Final Result

```
max_freq = 3
```

* Maximum frequency achievable = **3**
* Example of elements we can make equal: `[1,1,3] → [3,3,3]` or `[3,4,5] → [5,5,5]`
