1. **Class Definition**: The `Solution` class contains a method `prefixCount` that solves the problem of counting how many words in the list `words` have a prefix that matches the string `pref`.

2. **Method Definition**: `prefixCount(self, words: List[str], pref: str) -> int`:  
   - This method takes two parameters:
     - `words`: A list of strings.
     - `pref`: A string that represents the prefix to check.

3. **Count Variable**:  
   The variable `count` is initialized to `0` and will be used to store the number of words in the list `words` that start with the given prefix `pref`.

4. **Iterating Through the List**:  
   The method iterates over each string `i` in the list `words` using a `for` loop.

5. **Prefix Comparison**:  
   Inside the loop, for each word `i`, the code checks if the first `len(pref)` characters of `i` match the string `pref`. This is done by using slicing: `i[:len(pref)]`.

6. **Condition**:  
   If the condition `pref == i[:len(pref)]` evaluates to `True`, it means that the current word starts with the specified prefix `pref`.

7. **Incrementing Count**:  
   When the condition is satisfied (i.e., a word starts with the given prefix), the `count` is incremented by 1.

8. **Returning Result**:  
   After the loop completes, the method returns the value of `count`, which represents how many words in the list start with the prefix `pref`.

9. **Time Complexity**:  
   - Time complexity is **O(n * m)**, where `n` is the number of words and `m` is the average length of the words. This is because for each word, we check if the prefix matches, and this comparison takes `O(m)` time.

10. **Space Complexity**:  
    The space complexity is **O(1)**, excluding the space required for the input `words` and `pref`, as the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space.

### Example:

Letâ€™s consider the following example:

```python
words = ["apple", "appreciate", "banana", "applied", "application"]
pref = "app"
```

#### Step-by-step Walkthrough:

1. `count` is initialized to `0`.
2. The loop starts with the first word "apple":
   - `i[:len(pref)]` is `"apple"[:3]` which is `"app"`.
   - Since `"app" == "app"`, increment `count` to 1.
3. Move to the second word "appreciate":
   - `i[:len(pref)]` is `"appreciate"[:3]` which is `"app"`.
   - Since `"app" == "app"`, increment `count` to 2.
4. Move to the third word "banana":
   - `i[:len(pref)]` is `"banana"[:3]` which is `"ban"`.
   - Since `"ban" != "app"`, `count` remains 2.
5. Move to the fourth word "applied":
   - `i[:len(pref)]` is `"applied"[:3]` which is `"app"`.
   - Since `"app" == "app"`, increment `count` to 3.
6. Move to the fifth word "application":
   - `i[:len(pref)]` is `"application"[:3]` which is `"app"`.
   - Since `"app" == "app"`, increment `count` to 4.
7. The loop ends, and the method returns `count`, which is 4.

Thus, the number of words in `words` that start with the prefix `"app"` is 4.

### Final Output:

```python
result = solution.prefixCount(["apple", "appreciate", "banana", "applied", "application"], "app")
print(result)  # Output: 4
```
