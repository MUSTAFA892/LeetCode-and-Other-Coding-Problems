1. **Sorting the Input Array (`nums.sort()`)**:
   - Sorting helps because once the array is sorted, we can use the two-pointer (sliding window) technique to find the longest subsequence where each element can be transformed into one value. By checking ranges more efficiently, we avoid needing to check all pairs.

2. **Initializing Variables (`ans`, `l`, `r`)**:
   - `ans`: This variable stores the maximum length of the subsequence that can be transformed into one value (the beauty of the array).
   - `l` and `r`: These are the two pointers that represent the left and right ends of the sliding window.

3. **Sliding Window Mechanism**:
   - The two pointers (`l` and `r`) form a window where the difference between the largest element (`nums[r]`) and the smallest element (`nums[l]`) is being tracked.
   - If this difference exceeds `2 * k`, we move the left pointer (`l`) to the right to shrink the window and ensure that all elements in the window can be transformed to one value.

4. **Check Window Validity (`nums[r] - nums[l] > 2 * k`)**:
   - The condition checks whether the difference between `nums[r]` (rightmost element) and `nums[l]` (leftmost element) is greater than `2 * k`. If the difference is too large, then the elements in the window cannot be transformed into a single value, so the left pointer (`l`) is incremented to shrink the window.
   
5. **Update Maximum Beauty (`ans = max(ans, r - l + 1)`)**:
   - After each adjustment to the window (either moving the right pointer or the left pointer), we calculate the length of the current valid window (`r - l + 1`) and update `ans` to store the maximum length of such a subsequence encountered.

6. **Right Pointer Increment (`r += 1`)**:
   - After checking the current window, we increment `r` to expand the window and consider the next element.

7. **Return the Result**:
   - After iterating through the entire array with the sliding window, `ans` contains the maximum length of the subsequence where all elements can be transformed into a single value within the allowed range.

### Working Walkthrough with Example:

Let’s use an example to walk through the code:

**Example:**
```python
nums = [1, 3, 4, 2]
k = 1
```

#### Step 1: Sort the Array
```python
nums.sort()  # Now nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

#### Step 2: Initialize Variables
```python
n = 4  # Length of nums
ans = 0  # Maximum beauty of the array
l = 0  # Left pointer
r = 0  # Right pointer
```

#### Step 3: Sliding Window Loop

##### First iteration (`r = 0`):
- We check if the difference between `nums[r]` and `nums[l]` is greater than `2 * k`:
  - `nums[r] - nums[l] = nums[0] - nums[0] = 0`, which is not greater than `2 * k = 2`.
- We update the answer:
  - `ans = max(ans, r - l + 1) = max(0, 0 - 0 + 1) = 1`.
- Move the right pointer:
  - `r += 1` → `r = 1`.

##### Second iteration (`r = 1`):
- We check if the difference between `nums[r]` and `nums[l]` is greater than `2 * k`:
  - `nums[r] - nums[l] = nums[1] - nums[0] = 2 - 1 = 1`, which is not greater than `2 * k = 2`.
- We update the answer:
  - `ans = max(ans, r - l + 1) = max(1, 1 - 0 + 1) = 2`.
- Move the right pointer:
  - `r += 1` → `r = 2`.

##### Third iteration (`r = 2`):
- We check if the difference between `nums[r]` and `nums[l]` is greater than `2 * k`:
  - `nums[r] - nums[l] = nums[2] - nums[0] = 3 - 1 = 2`, which is not greater than `2 * k = 2`.
- We update the answer:
  - `ans = max(ans, r - l + 1) = max(2, 2 - 0 + 1) = 3`.
- Move the right pointer:
  - `r += 1` → `r = 3`.

##### Fourth iteration (`r = 3`):
- We check if the difference between `nums[r]` and `nums[l]` is greater than `2 * k`:
  - `nums[r] - nums[l] = nums[3] - nums[0] = 4 - 1 = 3`, which **is greater than** `2 * k = 2`.
  - So, we increment the left pointer to shrink the window:
    - `l += 1` → `l = 1`.
- Now the window contains `nums[1]`, `nums[2]`, and `nums[3]` (i.e., `[2, 3, 4]`).
- We update the answer again:
  - `ans = max(ans, r - l + 1) = max(3, 3 - 1 + 1) = 3`.
- Move the right pointer:
  - `r += 1` → `r = 4`.

#### Step 4: End of the Loop
- Now, `r = 4`, which is equal to the length of the array (`n = 4`), so the loop terminates.

#### Final Answer:
- The maximum beauty found is `ans = 3`.
