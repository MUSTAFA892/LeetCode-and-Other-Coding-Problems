## **How Your Code Works**

### **Class Structure**

* `Node` → Represents a single node in the linked list (has `data` and `next` pointer).
* `LL` → Manages the linked list (head pointer + methods).

---

### **Method Breakdown**

#### 1. **insert(self, data)**

* Creates a new node with the given `data`.
* Inserts it at the **start** of the list:

  * `temp.next = self.head` links the new node to the old head.
  * `self.head = temp` updates the head to the new node.

Example after:

```python
ll.insert(5)
ll.insert(4)
```

List becomes:

```
self.head → [4] → [5] → None
```

---

#### 2. **traverse(self)**

* Starts at `self.head`
* Prints each node’s `data` and moves to the `.next` node until `None`.

---

#### 3. **starting\_deletion(self)**

* Simply does:

```python
self.head = self.head.next
```

* Deletes the first node by making head point to the second node.

---

#### 4. **deletion\_by\_val(self, val)**

Purpose: Delete the **first occurrence** of a node with value `val`.

Logic flow:

1. Start at head:

```python
current = self.head
```

2. If head contains the value:

```python
if current.data == val:
    self.head = self.head.next
```

✅ Works fine for deleting the head.

3. Else, traverse the list:

```python
while current:
    if current.data == val:
        prev.next = current.next
        print(f"The value {val} is deleted from the node")
        break
    prev = current
    current = current.next
```

Here:

* `prev` is the node before `current`
* `prev.next = current.next` “skips” over the node being deleted

---

## **Problem in Your Current Code**

* **`prev` is never initialized** before the `while` loop, so the first time you reach `prev.next` you’ll get a `NameError`.
* You also **don’t move `current`** if the value is in the head (after updating head), which can be fine if you just break.
* The loop runs even if `val` is in the head — you already handled head deletion, so that loop is for non-head only.

---

## **Corrected Version**

```python
def deletion_by_val(self, val):
    current = self.head
    prev = None

    # If head node holds the value
    if current and current.data == val:
        self.head = current.next
        print(f"The value {val} (head node) is deleted")
        return

    # Traverse for non-head deletion
    while current:
        if current.data == val:
            prev.next = current.next
            print(f"The value {val} is deleted from the node")
            return
        prev = current
        current = current.next
```

---

## **Execution Example**

List after inserts:

```
self.head → [5] → [4] → [3] → [2] → [1] → None
```

### Deleting value `4`:

* `current = [5]`, `prev = None`
* `5 != 4` → move:

```
prev = [5]
current = [4]
```

* Match found → `prev.next = [3]`
* New list:

```
self.head → [5] → [3] → [2] → [1] → None
```

* `[4]` is now disconnected.

---

## **Key Notes**

1. Always initialize `prev = None` before traversal.
2. Only update `self.head` when deleting the **head node**.
3. For non-head deletion, always do:

```python
prev.next = current.next
```

4. Use `break` or `return` after deletion to stop further traversal.
5. If `current` becomes `None` and no match is found, print a message like `"Value not found"`.
