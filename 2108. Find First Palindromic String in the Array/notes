# ✅ Problem Goal 

Given a list of strings:

👉 **return the first word that is a palindrome**
(A palindrome reads the same forward & backward)

If **none** are palindromes → return an empty string `""`.

---

# 🧩 Step-by-Step Explanation

## 🔹 Loop through each word

```python
for i in words:
```

`i` is each string in the list.

---

## 🔹 Check if the word is a palindrome

```python
if i == i[::-1]:
```

### What is `i[::-1]`?

It means:
👉 create a **reversed copy** of the string

Example:

```
"abc"[::-1] → "cba"
"racecar"[::-1] → "racecar"
```

So:

* if **original == reversed**
* then it’s a palindrome

---

## 🔹 If palindrome → return it immediately

```python
return i
```

Because we only want the **first one**.

Loop stops here.

---

## 🔹 If loop finishes with no palindrome

```python
return ""
```

Meaning:
👉 nothing matched

---

# 🎯 Key Behavior

* First palindrome — returned ✔
* Others later — ignored ✖
* No palindrome — return empty ✔

# 🧪 Working Example

### Input

```
words = ["abc", "car", "ada", "racecar", "cool"]
```

### Execution Flow

1️⃣ Check `"abc"`

```
"abc" != "cba"   → not palindrome
```

2️⃣ Check `"car"`

```
"car" != "rac"   → not palindrome
```

3️⃣ Check `"ada"`

```
"ada" == "ada"   → palindrome!
```

So the function returns:

```
"ada"
```

Stops there — `"racecar"` is never checked.

---

# 🧪 Another Example

### Input

```
["not","a","single","pal"]
```

Check each:

```
"not"   != "ton"
"a"     == "a"   → palindrome
```

So output:

```
"a"
```

---

# 🧪 Example With No Palindromes

### Input

```
["abc","def","ghi"]
```

None match
So result:

```
""
```
