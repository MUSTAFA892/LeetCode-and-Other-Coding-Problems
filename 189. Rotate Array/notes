1. In the given problem we have to perform a rotation in the array by pushing the number of values given  k forward in the array ..

2.We can go with the three reverse approach first we will reverse the entire the array...

3. And then we have to and then we will again reverse the 0 to k index and in the second loop reverse the k to length of the array index and at the last you will get the precise output..

4.  first loop = [7,6,5,4,3,2,1]

5. Second loop = [5,6,7,4,3,2,1]

6. Third loop = [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
