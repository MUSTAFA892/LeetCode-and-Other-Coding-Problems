# ✅ **Code Explanation (Simple and Clear)**

```python
gap = 0
previous_index = -1
```

* `previous_index = -1` means: **we have not seen a 1 yet**.
* `gap` will store the zeros between two 1s.

---

```python
for i in range(len(nums)):
```

Loop through each index of the array.

---

```python
if nums[i] == 1:
```

We only care when we find a **1**.

---

### ⭐ **Case 1: First time we see a 1**

```python
if previous_index == -1:
    previous_index = i
    continue
```

* If `previous_index == -1`, this means it is the **first** 1.
* We store its index.
* We skip gap checking because no earlier 1 exists.

---

### ⭐ **Case 2: We already have a previous 1**

Now we calculate the gap:

```python
gap = i - previous_index - 1
```

Example: 1 _ _ _ 1
Indexes: 0 and 4
Gap = 4 - 0 - 1 = 3 zeros.

---

Then check if this gap satisfies the rule:

```python
if gap >= k:
    previous_index = i
    continue
```

* If the distance is **good** (>= k), update previous_index.
* Continue checking the next numbers.

---

If gap is **smaller than k**, rule is broken:

```python
else:
    return False
```

---

If the loop finishes without returning False:

```python
return True
```

Meaning:
✔ All 1s were at least distance `k` apart.

# 🔍 **Working Example**

### Input:

```
nums = [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
k = 2
```

Indexes of 1s → 0, 4, 7
`k = 2`

---

### Step-by-step:

---

### **i = 0 → nums[0] = 1**

`previous_index == -1` → This is the first 1.

So:

```
previous_index = 0
```

---

### **i = 4 → nums[4] = 1**

Now compute gap:

```
gap = 4 - 0 - 1 = 3
```

Check:

```
3 >= 2 → OK
```

Update:

```
previous_index = 4
```

---

### **i = 7 → nums[7] = 1**

Compute gap:

```
gap = 7 - 4 - 1 = 2
```

Check:

```
2 >= 2 → OK
```

Update:

```
previous_index = 7
```

---

Loop ends → No violation → Return:

```
True
```
