1. **Class and Function Definition**:
   - You define a class `Solution` with a method `kthSmallestPrimeFraction` that takes two arguments: a sorted list `arr` of prime numbers (with `1` as its first element) and an integer `k` representing which smallest fraction you need to return.

2. **Initializing the List**:
   - `ans = []` initializes an empty list called `ans` which will store the fractions in the form of tuples `(fraction_value, numerator, denominator)`.

3. **First `for` Loop**:
   - The outer loop `for i in range(len(arr))` iterates over the array `arr`. The index `i` points to the numerator `arr[i]` for the fraction to be generated.

4. **Second `for` Loop**:
   - The inner loop `for j in range(i + 1, len(arr))` ensures that the denominator `arr[j]` is always greater than the numerator `arr[i]` by starting `j` from `i + 1`. This prevents generating improper or duplicate fractions like `arr[i] / arr[i]` or repeating combinations.

5. **Appending Fractions**:
   - Inside the nested loop, the expression `arr[i] / arr[j]` computes the value of the fraction formed by the elements at index `i` and `j`. 
   - The tuple `(fraction_value, numerator, denominator)` is appended to the list `ans`, where `fraction_value` is the actual computed fraction.

6. **Storing Tuples**:
   - The tuples stored in `ans` consist of three parts: the fraction value, the numerator `arr[i]`, and the denominator `arr[j]`. 
   - Example: If `arr = [1, 2, 3, 5]`, one tuple could be `(1/5, 1, 5)`.

7. **Sorting the List**:
   - After both loops complete, `ans` contains all possible fractions formed by `arr[i] / arr[j]` where `i < j`.
   - `ans.sort()` sorts the list of tuples based on the fraction value (the first element in each tuple). Pythonâ€™s default sorting will order the tuples by their first element, which is the fraction value.

8. **Accessing the k-th Smallest Fraction**:
   - Since `ans` is sorted in increasing order of fraction values, the `k-th` smallest fraction will be at index `k - 1` (because Python uses zero-based indexing).
   - You access this fraction using `ans[k-1]`.

9. **Returning the Result**:
   - The method returns a list containing the numerator and denominator of the `k-th` smallest fraction: `[ans[k-1][1], ans[k-1][2]]`. This extracts the second and third elements (the numerator and denominator) from the tuple at `ans[k-1]`.

10. **Final Output**:
    - The output will be a list `[numerator, denominator]` of the k-th smallest fraction. For example, if `arr = [1, 2, 3, 5]` and `k = 3`, the third smallest fraction is `2/5`, so the output will be `[2, 5]`.

### Example Walkthrough:

For `arr = [1, 2, 3, 5]` and `k = 3`:

- The fractions generated are: `1/5, 1/3, 2/5, 1/2, 3/5, 2/3`.
- After sorting, these fractions are in this order: `1/5, 1/3, 2/5, 1/2, 3/5, 2/3`.
- The third smallest fraction is `2/5`, so the output will be `[2, 5]`.

This approach generates all possible fractions, sorts them, and returns the desired fraction in terms of the numerator and denominator.
