1. Now this problem is very similar to the previous 121th problem in which u are allowed to buy only one stock which would be profitable in future in a single day.

2. But in this problem u can buy as many as stock in a each single day..

3. Its the simple logic in which u will compare the stocks of i and  i-1 if i greater than subtract those both stocks i - (i-1) and then u will add it to the profit..

4. And continue  the loop until u can get final profit after u get all the profitable ones..

5. And then return the profit..
