1.  In this question we have two arrays and also two variables names m and n which are storing the length of the array..

2. Now the logic is take the second elements of the second array given and store it in the first array with sorted order and at last return the first array

3. Now we can implement it keeping track of the first array elemet index with t1

4. Same foe the second array track it by using the t2.

5. and now take the t for storing the sum of the length of both t1 and t2.

6. implement the condition if t2 greater than or equal to 0..

7. Check the first condtion where t1 greater than 0 and element of t1 >element of t2 then replace the element of t1 with the total element of t and decrement 1 in t1

8. otherwise replace the element of t with the element of t2 and again decrement 1 in t2

9. And at last decrement 1 in t...
