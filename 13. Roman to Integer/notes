1. **Function Definition**: Defines the `romanToInt` method that converts a Roman numeral string `s` to an integer.
2. **Mapping Dictionary**: Creates a dictionary `d` mapping Roman numerals to their integer values.
3. **Variable Initialization**: Initializes `i` to 0, `sum` to 0, and `n` to the length of the input string `s`.
4. **Start Loop**: Begins a while loop to iterate over the string `s`.
5. **Subtractive Notation Check**: Checks if the current character is less than the next character (subtractive notation).
6. **Add Subtractive Value**: Adds the result of the next character's value minus the current character's value to `sum`.
7. **Skip Next Character**: Increments `i` by 2 to skip the next character.
8. **Add Regular Value**: Adds the value of the current character to `sum` if no subtractive notation is found.
9. **Increment Index**: Increments `i` by 1 to move to the next character.
10. **Return Result**: Returns the accumulated `sum` as the final integer value.
