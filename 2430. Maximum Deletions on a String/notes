1. **Initialization:**
   - We initialize a `dp` array with length `n` (the length of the string `s`). Each `dp[i]` will store the maximum number of operations needed to delete the string starting from index `i`.
   - Initially, `dp[i] = 1` because, in the worst case, deleting the string starting at any index can take at least one operation (by removing one character at a time).

2. **Outer Loop (Iterating from right to left):**
   - We iterate backward from `n-2` to `0`. This is because we want to find the best possible number of operations starting from any index `i`, and we need to check if matching prefixes later in the string can help.

3. **Inner Loop (Comparing prefixes):**
   - For each index `i`, we compare its prefix with the next segment of the string starting from `j = i + 1` to `n`.
   - We check if the substring `s[i:i+k]` is equal to the substring `s[j:j+k]` for all `k` such that `i+k` does not exceed `n`. If the two prefixes match, then `dp[i]` can be updated with the maximum of the current value of `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`.

4. **Final Result:**
   - The maximum number of operations required to delete the string starting from index `0` is stored in `dp[0]`.

### Example Walkthrough:

Let's consider the string `s = "ababc"`.

#### Step 1: Initialize `dp` Array

- `dp = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` (initially set all values to 1)

#### Step 2: Iterate from `n-2` to `0`:

##### Iteration 1 (`i = 3`):
- We are comparing the substring starting at index `3`, i.e., `"c"`. Since there are no matching prefixes for the string starting at index `3`, `dp[3]` remains `1`.

##### Iteration 2 (`i = 2`):
- We are comparing the substring starting at index `2`, i.e., `"ab"`.
  - We check if `"ab"` matches any part of the string after index `2`. We find that `s[2:4]` (`"ab"`) matches `s[0:2]` (`"ab"`), so we can perform the operation and get a maximum of `dp[2] = dp[4] + 1 = 2`.
  - Therefore, `dp[2] = 2`.

##### Iteration 3 (`i = 1`):
- We are comparing the substring starting at index `1`, i.e., `"ba"`.
  - We check if `"ba"` matches any part of the string after index `1`. We find that `s[1:3]` (`"ba"`) matches `s[0:2]` (`"ba"`), so we can perform the operation and get a maximum of `dp[1] = dp[3] + 1 = 2`.
  - Therefore, `dp[1] = 2`.

##### Iteration 4 (`i = 0`):
- We are comparing the substring starting at index `0`, i.e., `"ab"`.
  - We check if `"ab"` matches any part of the string after index `0`. We find that `s[0:2]` (`"ab"`) matches `s[2:4]` (`"ab"`), so we can perform the operation and get a maximum of `dp[0] = dp[2] + 1 = 3`.
  - Therefore, `dp[0] = 3`.

#### Final `dp` Array:
- After processing all indices, the `dp` array looks like this: `dp = [3, 2, 2, 1, 1]`.

#### Final Answer:
- The answer is `dp[0] = 3`, meaning the maximum number of operations needed to delete the entire string is **3**.
