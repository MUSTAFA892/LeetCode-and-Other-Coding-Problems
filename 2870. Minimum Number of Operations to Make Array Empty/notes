1. **Class Definition:**
   - `class Solution:` — The `Solution` class is defined as per the typical structure on platforms like LeetCode. The method `minOperations` is defined within this class.

2. **Method Definition:**
   - `def minOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:` — This defines the method `minOperations`. It accepts a list of integers, `nums`, and returns an integer. The `-> int` annotation means the function will return an integer value.

3. **Count Frequency of Each Element:**
   - `s = Counter(nums)` — This uses the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each element in the input list `nums`. The `Counter` object `s` will store these frequencies in a dictionary-like structure.
     Example: For `nums = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]`, `s` will be `Counter({1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 1})`.

4. **Initialize `ope` (Operations Counter):**
   - `ope = 0` — This initializes the variable `ope` to zero. `ope` will keep track of the number of operations needed to make the frequencies of the numbers in `nums` meet the desired condition (multiples of 3).

5. **Loop Through Frequency Counts:**
   - `for i in s.values():` — This loops through all the frequency values in the `Counter` object `s`. Each `i` represents the count of occurrences of a particular number in the list `nums`.

6. **Check for Impossible Cases:**
   - `if i == 1:` — If any element in `nums` occurs exactly once, it's impossible to group it into multiples of 3 (because 1 is not divisible by 3). In this case, the function returns `-1`, signaling that it's impossible to make the number appear in groups of 3.
   - `return -1` — This terminates the function early and returns `-1` if any element in `nums` occurs exactly once.

7. **Operations Calculation:**
   - `ope += i // 3` — This performs integer division to calculate how many groups of 3 can be formed from `i` occurrences of a number. For example, if `i = 7`, then `7 // 3 = 2` groups of 3 can be formed.
   - `if i % 3 != 0:` — This checks if there is a remainder when `i` is divided by 3. If there is a remainder (i.e., `i % 3 != 0`), we need one more operation to handle the leftover numbers that don't fit in groups of 3. This is why we add 1 to `ope`.

8. **Return Final Result:**
   - `return ope` — After processing all frequencies, the function returns the total number of operations stored in `ope`, which represents the minimum number of operations needed to group numbers into multiples of 3 or handle the leftover cases.

### Example:

**Input:**
- `nums = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`

**Step-by-Step Execution:**

1. **Count Frequencies:** 
   - `s = Counter(nums)` will result in:
     ```python
     Counter({3: 6, 1: 3, 2: 3})
     ```

2. **Loop Through Frequencies:**

   - For `i = 3` (number `1` appears 3 times):
     - `ope += 3 // 3 = 1` (1 group of 3 can be formed)
     - No remainder, so no additional operation needed.

   - For `i = 3` (number `2` appears 3 times):
     - `ope += 3 // 3 = 1` (1 group of 3 can be formed)
     - No remainder, so no additional operation needed.

   - For `i = 6` (number `3` appears 6 times):
     - `ope += 6 // 3 = 2` (2 groups of 3 can be formed)
     - No remainder, so no additional operation needed.

3. **Final Result:** 
   - `ope = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4`
   
**Output:**
- `4` operations are needed to group all numbers in multiples of 3.

### Edge Case:

- If `nums = [1]`, the output would be `-1` because it's impossible to group a single element into multiples of 3.
  
### Output for Example:

```
4
