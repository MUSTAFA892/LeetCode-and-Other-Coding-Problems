1. **Class Definition**:
   - The class `Solution` is created to encapsulate the solution for the problem.

2. **Method Definition**:
   - The method `stringMatching` takes a list of strings `words` as input and returns a list of strings that are substrings of any other word in the list.

3. **Initialization**:
   - The list `result` is initialized to store the words that meet the condition of being a substring of another word.

4. **Outer Loop**:
   - The outer loop iterates over each word in the list. The index `i` keeps track of the current word being processed.

5. **Inner Loop**:
   - The inner loop also iterates over each word in the list. The index `j` is used to compare the current word `words[i]` against all other words `words[j]`.

6. **Condition `i != j`**:
   - The condition `i != j` ensures that the current word `words[i]` is not compared with itself. It avoids checking if a word is a substring of itself.

7. **Substring Check**:
   - The condition `words[i] in words[j]` checks if the word at index `i` is a substring of the word at index `j`.

8. **Adding to Result**:
   - If `words[i]` is found to be a substring of `words[j]`, it is added to the result list.

9. **Break Statement**:
   - The `break` statement ensures that once a match is found for `words[i]` (i.e., it is a substring of another word), it is added to the result, and no further comparisons for `words[i]` are done in the inner loop.

10. **Return Statement**:
    - The `result` list, containing the substrings found, is returned as the output of the method.

### Example:

#### Input:
```python
words = ["mass", "as", "hero", "superhero"]
```

#### Execution:
1. First, the word `mass` is compared against each word in the list.
   - It is not a substring of itself (since `i != j`).
   - It is a substring of `superhero`, so `mass` is added to the result list and the inner loop is exited.
   
2. Next, the word `as` is compared against each word in the list.
   - It is a substring of `mass`, so `as` is added to the result list and the inner loop is exited.

3. The word `hero` is compared with each word in the list.
   - It is a substring of `superhero`, so `hero` is added to the result list and the inner loop is exited.

4. Finally, `superhero` is compared with each word in the list.
   - It is not a substring of any other word, so it is not added to the result.

#### Output:
```python
["mass", "as", "hero"]
```
