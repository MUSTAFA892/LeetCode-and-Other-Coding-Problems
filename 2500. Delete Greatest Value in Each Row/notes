1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `deleteGreatestValue` is defined to take `grid`, a list of lists, as input. Each inner list represents a row of the grid.

2. **Variable `ans`**:
   - An empty list `ans` is initialized. This list will store the maximum values found in each operation, which will be summed up later.

3. **Outer While Loop**:
   - The `while len(grid[0]) > 0` loop ensures that the process continues as long as there are columns left in the grid. It checks the number of columns by looking at the length of the first row (`grid[0]`), which should be the same for all rows since it's a rectangular grid.

4. **Inner For Loop**:
   - The inner `for row in grid:` loop iterates through each row in the grid.

5. **Finding Maximum in Each Row**:
   - For each row, `max(row)` is used to find the maximum value. This value is added to the `max_value` list, which keeps track of the maximum values found in each row during the current iteration.

6. **Removing the Maximum from Each Row**:
   - After finding the maximum value for each row, `row.remove(max_)` is used to remove that maximum value from the row. This reduces the number of columns in the grid by one for each row.

7. **Finding Maximum of Row Maximums**:
   - `max(max_value)` is used to find the largest value from the list `max_value`, which contains the maximums from each row. This value is appended to the `ans` list, as it represents the greatest value deleted in this iteration.

8. **Repeating the Process**:
   - The `while` loop continues to repeat this process of removing the greatest value from each row until all columns have been processed.

9. **Returning the Result**:
   - Once all columns are removed, the final result is the sum of the values stored in the `ans` list, which is returned by the function.

10. **Time Complexity**:
    - The time complexity of this approach is **O(m * n^2)**, where `m` is the number of rows, and `n` is the number of columns. This complexity arises because for each iteration of the `while` loop, we perform `O(m * n)` operations (finding and removing the maximums), and the `while` loop runs `n` times.

### Example Walkthrough:

Consider the following example:

```python
grid = [
    [1, 2, 4],
    [3, 3, 1]
]
```

#### Initial Grid:
```
grid = [[1, 2, 4], 
        [3, 3, 1]]
```

### Step-by-Step Execution:

#### First Iteration of While Loop (`len(grid[0]) = 3`):
1. **Finding the Maximum in Each Row**:
   - For row 1: `max([1, 2, 4]) = 4`
   - For row 2: `max([3, 3, 1]) = 3`

2. **Removing the Maximum from Each Row**:
   - Remove `4` from row 1: `row[1, 2]`
   - Remove `3` from row 2: `row[3, 1]`

3. **Finding the Maximum of `max_value` List**:
   - `max_value = [4, 3]`
   - `max(max_value) = 4`

4. **Appending the Maximum to `ans`**:
   - `ans = [4]`

#### Grid after First Iteration:
```
grid = [[1, 2], 
        [3, 1]]
```

#### Second Iteration of While Loop (`len(grid[0]) = 2`):
1. **Finding the Maximum in Each Row**:
   - For row 1: `max([1, 2]) = 2`
   - For row 2: `max([3, 1]) = 3`

2. **Removing the Maximum from Each Row**:
   - Remove `2` from row 1: `row[1]`
   - Remove `3` from row 2: `row[1]`

3. **Finding the Maximum of `max_value` List**:
   - `max_value = [2, 3]`
   - `max(max_value) = 3`

4. **Appending the Maximum to `ans`**:
   - `ans = [4, 3]`

#### Grid after Second Iteration:
```
grid = [[1], 
        [1]]
```

#### Third Iteration of While Loop (`len(grid[0]) = 1`):
1. **Finding the Maximum in Each Row**:
   - For row 1: `max([1]) = 1`
   - For row 2: `max([1]) = 1`

2. **Removing the Maximum from Each Row**:
   - Remove `1` from row 1: `row[]`
   - Remove `1` from row 2: `row[]`

3. **Finding the Maximum of `max_value` List**:
   - `max_value = [1, 1]`
   - `max(max_value) = 1`

4. **Appending the Maximum to `ans`**:
   - `ans = [4, 3, 1]`

#### Grid after Third Iteration:
```
grid = [[], []]
```

### Final Step:
- The `while` loop ends because there are no columns left in the grid.
- The sum of the values in `ans = [4, 3, 1]` is `4 + 3 + 1 = 8`.

### Final Output:
```python
return 8
```
