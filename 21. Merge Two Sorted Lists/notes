    def mergeTwoLists(self, list1: Optional[ListNode], list2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy_list = ListNode()      # Step 1: Initialize a dummy node to build the merged list
        current = dummy_list         # Step 2: Create a pointer 'current' to traverse and build the list

        while list1 and list2:       # Step 3: Traverse both lists until one of them becomes empty
            if list1.val > list2.val:    # Step 4: Compare the current values of list1 and list2
                current.next = list2     # Step 5: Add the smaller node to the merged list
                list2 = list2.next       # Step 6: Move the pointer of list2 ahead
            else:
                current.next = list1     # Step 7: Add the smaller or equal node from list1
                list1 = list1.next       # Step 8: Move the pointer of list1 ahead
            current = current.next       # Step 9: Move the 'current' pointer ahead in the merged list

        if list1:                    # Step 10: If list1 has remaining elements, append them
            current.next = list1
        else:                        # Step 11: If list2 has remaining elements, append them
            current.next = list2

        return dummy_list.next        # Step 12: Return the merged list, skipping the dummy node
```

### Example Walkthrough

Consider two linked lists:
- **list1:** 1 → 3 → 5
- **list2:** 2 → 4 → 6

#### Step-by-Step Execution

1. **Initialization:**
   - `dummy_list = ListNode()` creates a new dummy node with value `0` to start the merged list.
   - `current = dummy_list` initializes a pointer `current` to the dummy node, which will be used to build the final merged list.

2. **First iteration of the `while` loop:**
   - `list1.val = 1`, `list2.val = 2`.
   - Since `1 < 2`, the node with value `1` from `list1` is added to the merged list:
     - `current.next = list1` → the dummy list now looks like: `0 → 1`.
   - Move the pointer of `list1`: `list1 = list1.next` (now pointing to node `3`).
   - Move `current` pointer to the next node in the merged list: `current = current.next` (now pointing to node `1`).

3. **Second iteration:**
   - `list1.val = 3`, `list2.val = 2`.
   - Since `2 < 3`, the node with value `2` from `list2` is added to the merged list:
     - `current.next = list2` → the list now looks like: `0 → 1 → 2`.
   - Move the pointer of `list2`: `list2 = list2.next` (now pointing to node `4`).
   - Move `current` to node `2`.

4. **Third iteration:**
   - `list1.val = 3`, `list2.val = 4`.
   - Since `3 < 4`, the node with value `3` from `list1` is added to the merged list:
     - `current.next = list1` → the list now looks like: `0 → 1 → 2 → 3`.
   - Move `list1` to node `5`, move `current` to node `3`.

5. **Fourth iteration:**
   - `list1.val = 5`, `list2.val = 4`.
   - Since `4 < 5`, the node with value `4` from `list2` is added to the merged list:
     - `current.next = list2` → the list now looks like: `0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4`.
   - Move `list2` to node `6`, move `current` to node `4`.

6. **Fifth iteration:**
   - `list1.val = 5`, `list2.val = 6`.
   - Since `5 < 6`, the node with value `5` from `list1` is added to the merged list:
     - `current.next = list1` → the list now looks like: `0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5`.
   - Move `list1` to `None` (end of list), move `current` to node `5`.

7. **Exit the `while` loop:**
   - Now `list1` is `None`, and `list2` is still pointing to `6`.

8. **Append remaining nodes:**
   - Since `list1` is `None`, the remaining node `6` from `list2` is appended to the merged list:
     - `current.next = list2` → the final list looks like: `0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6`.

9. **Return the result:**
   - The merged list starts after the dummy node, so `dummy_list.next` is returned.
   - The final result is: `1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6`.

### Final Merged List
The merged list is: **1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6**.

### Key Points:
- The `dummy_list` is used as a placeholder to simplify the logic of merging the two lists.
- `current` is used to keep track of where the next smallest element should be added.
- After the loop, any remaining elements from either list are directly appended to the merged list.

This approach ensures that the merged list remains sorted in ascending order.
