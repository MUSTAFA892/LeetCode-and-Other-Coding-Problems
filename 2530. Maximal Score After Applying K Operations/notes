1. **Importing Required Modules**:
   ```python
   import heapq
   import math
   ```
   - **`heapq`** is used to implement a priority queue (min-heap) in Python.
   - **`math`** provides the `ceil` function, which rounds numbers up.

2. **Class Definition**:
   ```python
   class Solution:
   ```
   - A class `Solution` is defined, which contains the method `maxKelements` to solve the problem.

3. **Function Definition**:
   ```python
   def maxKelements(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
   ```
   - The function `maxKelements` accepts two parameters:
     - **`nums`**: A list of integers.
     - **`k`**: The number of operations to perform.
   - The function returns the maximum possible score after `k` operations.

4. **Initialize `sum_val`**:
   ```python
   sum_val = 0
   ```
   - A variable `sum_val` is initialized to 0. This will store the cumulative score.

5. **Create a Max-Heap**:
   ```python
   max_heap = [-num for num in nums]
   heapq.heapify(max_heap)
   ```
   - We create a **max-heap** by negating all the values in `nums` (since Pythonâ€™s `heapq` is a **min-heap** by default).
   - `heapq.heapify(max_heap)` turns the list into a valid heap structure in O(n) time.

6. **Loop Through `k` Operations**:
   ```python
   for _ in range(k):
   ```
   - A loop is run for exactly `k` operations, where each operation modifies the heap and adds the largest element to the score.

7. **Pop the Largest Element from the Heap**:
   ```python
   Top_value = -heapq.heappop(max_heap)
   ```
   - The largest element is retrieved using `heapq.heappop()`, but since the elements are stored as negatives, we negate the popped value to get the original positive value (`Top_value`).
   
8. **Add the Largest Element to `sum_val`**:
   ```python
   sum_val += Top_value
   ```
   - The current maximum element (`Top_value`) is added to the running total `sum_val`.

9. **Modify and Push the Element Back into the Heap**:
   ```python
   Top_value = math.ceil(Top_value / 3.0)
   heapq.heappush(max_heap, -Top_value)
   ```
   - The current maximum element (`Top_value`) is divided by 3 and rounded up using `math.ceil()` (to follow the problem's rules).
   - The modified value is negated and pushed back into the heap to maintain the max-heap behavior.

10. **Return the Final Sum**:
   ```python
   return sum_val
   ```
   - After performing all `k` operations, the final score `sum_val` is returned.

### Example Walkthrough:

Let's say we have the input:
```python
nums = [10, 20, 7]
k = 4
```

#### Initial Heap:
- **Step 1**: Convert `nums` to a max-heap by negating the values:
   - Initial `max_heap = [-20, -10, -7]`
   - `sum_val = 0`

#### Operation 1:
1. Pop the largest value (`-20`, which corresponds to `20` when negated).
2. Add `20` to `sum_val`:  
   - `sum_val = 20`
3. Divide `20` by 3 and round up:  
   - `math.ceil(20 / 3.0) = 7`
4. Push `-7` back into the heap:  
   - Updated `max_heap = [-10, -7, -7]`

#### Operation 2:
1. Pop the largest value (`-10`, which corresponds to `10` when negated).
2. Add `10` to `sum_val`:  
   - `sum_val = 30`
3. Divide `10` by 3 and round up:  
   - `math.ceil(10 / 3.0) = 4`
4. Push `-4` back into the heap:  
   - Updated `max_heap = [-7, -7, -4]`

#### Operation 3:
1. Pop the largest value (`-7`, which corresponds to `7` when negated).
2. Add `7` to `sum_val`:  
   - `sum_val = 37`
3. Divide `7` by 3 and round up:  
   - `math.ceil(7 / 3.0) = 3`
4. Push `-3` back into the heap:  
   - Updated `max_heap = [-7, -4, -3]`

#### Operation 4:
1. Pop the largest value (`-7`, which corresponds to `7` when negated).
2. Add `7` to `sum_val`:  
   - `sum_val = 44`
3. Divide `7` by 3 and round up:  
   - `math.ceil(7 / 3.0) = 3`
4. Push `-3` back into the heap:  
   - Updated `max_heap = [-4, -3, -3]`

#### Final Result:
After 4 operations, the final score is:
```python
sum_val = 44
```
