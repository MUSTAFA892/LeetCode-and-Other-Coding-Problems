1. **Class Definition**:
   - The solution is defined inside a class `Solution`, with the method `maximumWealth()` that will be used to solve the problem.

2. **Input Parameter**:
   - The method takes a 2D list `accounts`, where each sublist represents a customer and the elements inside that sublist represent the amount of money in the customer's bank accounts.

3. **Initial `max_wealth` Variable**:
   - `max_wealth` is initialized to `0` at the start. This variable will hold the maximum wealth encountered during the iteration through all customers.

4. **For Loop Iteration**:
   - The outer loop iterates through each **customer** in the `accounts` list. Each customer is represented as a sublist of bank account balances.

5. **Calculate Wealth for Each Customer**:
   - Inside the loop, the total wealth of each customer is calculated using `sum(customer)`. This gives the sum of all account balances for that customer.

6. **Update `max_wealth`**:
   - For each customer, `max_wealth` is updated using `max(customer_wealth, max_wealth)`. This ensures that after each iteration, `max_wealth` holds the maximum wealth encountered so far.

7. **Time Complexity**:
   - The time complexity is **O(n * m)**, where `n` is the number of customers (i.e., the number of sublists in `accounts`) and `m` is the number of bank accounts per customer (i.e., the length of each sublist).

8. **Space Complexity**:
   - The space complexity is **O(1)** because we only use a fixed amount of extra space (`max_wealth`), irrespective of the input size.

9. **Return Statement**:
   - After the loop finishes, `max_wealth` holds the maximum wealth across all customers, and it is returned as the final result.

10. **Edge Case Considerations**:
   - If the `accounts` list is empty, the method will return `0` since `max_wealth` starts as `0` and no customer wealth will be calculated.
   - If each customer has a wealth of 0, the method will correctly return `0`.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Input:

```python
accounts = [[1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1], [2, 3, 1]]
```

#### Code Execution:

1. **Initialize `max_wealth = 0`**:
   - At the beginning, the maximum wealth is set to `0`.

2. **First Iteration (Customer 1)**:
   - `customer = [1, 2, 3]`
   - `customer_wealth = sum([1, 2, 3]) = 6`
   - `max_wealth = max(6, 0) = 6`
   - Now, `max_wealth` is updated to `6`.

3. **Second Iteration (Customer 2)**:
   - `customer = [3, 2, 1]`
   - `customer_wealth = sum([3, 2, 1]) = 6`
   - `max_wealth = max(6, 6) = 6`
   - `max_wealth` remains `6` because the second customer's wealth is equal to the current `max_wealth`.

4. **Third Iteration (Customer 3)**:
   - `customer = [2, 3, 1]`
   - `customer_wealth = sum([2, 3, 1]) = 6`
   - `max_wealth = max(6, 6) = 6`
   - Again, `max_wealth` remains `6` because the third customer's wealth is also equal to the current `max_wealth`.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - After iterating over all customers, the maximum wealth is `6`, so the method returns `6`.

#### Output:

```python
6
```

### Detailed Explanation:

- **First Iteration**:
  - The first customer has account balances `[1, 2, 3]`.
  - The wealth of the first customer is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.
  - We compare this wealth with the current `max_wealth` (which is initially 0). Since `6 > 0`, we update `max_wealth` to `6`.

- **Second Iteration**:
  - The second customer has account balances `[3, 2, 1]`.
  - The wealth of the second customer is `3 + 2 + 1 = 6`.
  - We compare `6` with the current `max_wealth` (which is 6). Since `6` is not greater than `6`, `max_wealth` remains `6`.

- **Third Iteration**:
  - The third customer has account balances `[2, 3, 1]`.
  - The wealth of the third customer is `2 + 3 + 1 = 6`.
  - Again, `6` is not greater than `6`, so `max_wealth` stays `6`.

After all iterations, the final value of `max_wealth` is `6`, which is returned as the result.
