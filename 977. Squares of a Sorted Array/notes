1. **Method Definition**: The method `sortedSquares` is defined within the `Solution` class, taking `nums` (a list of integers) as input.

2. **Empty List `st`**: An empty list `st` is initialized to store the squared values of elements in `nums`.

3. **For Loop Start**: The `for` loop iterates over each element `i` in the `nums` list.

4. **Square Calculation**: Inside the loop, the square of the current element `i` is computed using `i**2`.

5. **Appending Squared Values**: The squared result is appended to the list `st` using `st.append(i**2)`.

6. **Loop Repeats**: This process continues for each element in `nums`, effectively building a list of squared values.

7. **Sorting**: After the loop finishes, the `sorted()` function is called to sort the list `st`, which contains the squared values.

8. **Return Statement**: The sorted list of squared values is returned as the final result.

9. **Sorted Function**: The `sorted()` function sorts in ascending order by default, ensuring the squares are arranged from smallest to largest.

10. **Return Value**: The method ultimately returns the sorted squared list, providing the desired output.
