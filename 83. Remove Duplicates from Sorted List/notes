1. **Definition of the ListNode Class**:
   - Each node in the linked list is an instance of `ListNode`, which has two attributes:
     - `val`: The value of the node.
     - `next`: A pointer/reference to the next node in the list.

2. **Initialize `result`**:
   - A pointer `result` is set to reference the head of the linked list. This will allow returning the modified linked list after duplicates are removed.

3. **While Loop for Traversing the List**:
   - The loop continues until the end of the list (`head` becomes `None`), and it checks the current node and the next node for duplicates.

4. **Duplicate Detection**:
   - Inside the loop, if the current node’s value (`head.val`) is equal to the next node’s value (`head.next.val`), a duplicate is found. The `head.next` pointer is updated to skip the duplicate node (`head.next = head.next.next`).

5. **Moving the Pointer**:
   - If no duplicate is found, the pointer `head` moves to the next node (`head = head.next`) to continue checking the rest of the list.

6. **Return the Modified List**:
   - After all duplicates are removed, the modified linked list is returned by returning the `result` pointer, which still points to the head of the list.

### Example Workflow:

#### Input:
```python
Linked List: 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3
```

#### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - `result` points to the head: `1`.
   - `head` starts at the first node with value `1`.

2. **First Comparison** (`head = 1`):
   - `head.val == head.next.val`: `1 == 1` (True, duplicate found).
   - Skip the duplicate by updating the next pointer: `head.next = head.next.next`.
   - Now the list looks like: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3`.
   - `head` still points to the first node (`1`).

3. **Move to Next Node**:
   - No more duplicates at `head.val = 1`, so move `head = head.next`.
   - `head` now points to the node with value `2`.

4. **Second Comparison** (`head = 2`):
   - `head.val == head.next.val`: `2 == 3` (False, no duplicate).
   - Move `head = head.next`.
   - `head` now points to the node with value `3`.

5. **Third Comparison** (`head = 3`):
   - `head.val == head.next.val`: `3 == 3` (True, duplicate found).
   - Skip the duplicate by updating the next pointer: `head.next = head.next.next`.
   - Now the list looks like: `1 -> 2 -> 3`.
   - `head` still points to the first `3`.

6. **End of List**:
   - No more duplicates, move `head = head.next`.
   - `head` becomes `None` (end of the list), and the loop terminates.

#### Output:
```python
Linked List after removing duplicates: 1 -> 2 -> 3
```

### 10 Key Points of Explanation:

1. **ListNode Definition**: Each node has a value (`val`) and a pointer to the next node (`next`).
2. **Initial Pointer Setup**: `result` is a pointer that keeps track of the head of the list.
3. **Traversal**: The list is traversed using the `head` pointer, which moves from node to node.
4. **Duplicate Detection**: The function checks if the current node’s value is equal to the next node’s value.
5. **Removing Duplicates**: When duplicates are found, the `next` pointer of the current node is updated to skip the duplicate.
6. **Skipping Nodes**: When a duplicate is skipped, the list is shortened without affecting the original order.
7. **Advancing the Pointer**: If no duplicates are found, the `head` pointer moves to the next node.
8. **Termination**: The loop terminates when `head` becomes `None` (i.e., end of the list).
9. **Returning the Result**: The function returns `result`, which points to the modified list with duplicates removed.
10. **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the list since the list is traversed once.
