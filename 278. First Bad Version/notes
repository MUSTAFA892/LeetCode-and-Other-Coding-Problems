1. **Purpose:** The function finds the first bad version in a sequence of versions, where all versions after the first bad one are also bad.

2. **Binary Search Setup:**
   - Initialize `left` to 1 (the first version).
   - Initialize `right` to `n` (the total number of versions).

3. **Binary Search Loop:**
   - Continue the loop while `left < right`.
   - Calculate the midpoint `mid` as `(left + right) // 2`.

4. **Check Midpoint:**
   - If `isBadVersion(mid)` is `True`, it means that the first bad version is at `mid` or before it. So, set `right = mid`.
   - If `isBadVersion(mid)` is `False`, it means the first bad version is after `mid`. So, set `left = mid + 1`.

5. **Termination:**
   - The loop exits when `left` equals `right`, which will point to the first bad version.
   - Return `left`, which represents the index of the first bad version.

6. **Time Complexity:** The algorithm runs in O(log n) time, which is efficient even for large `n`.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `n` is 1, the function will correctly handle it.
   - If the first version is bad, the function will return 1.
   - If no bad version exists, the problem's constraints guarantee that this won't happen, so we don't need to handle it.

### Example:

**Scenario:**
Suppose you have 5 versions, and the first bad version is version 4.

- Versions: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- `isBadVersion(4)` returns `True`.
- `isBadVersion(3)` returns `False`.

**Steps:**

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - `left = 1`, `right = 5`

2. **First Iteration:**
   - `mid = (1 + 5) // 2 = 3`
   - Check `isBadVersion(3)` → `False`
   - Set `left = 3 + 1 = 4`

3. **Second Iteration:**
   - `mid = (4 + 5) // 2 = 4`
   - Check `isBadVersion(4)` → `True`
   - Set `right = 4`

4. **Termination:**
   - Now, `left = right = 4`
   - The loop exits, and the function returns `4`, which is the index of the first bad version.
