1. **Initialization**:
   - `n`: The length of the input string `s`.
   - `map_`: A dictionary to store the frequency of special substrings (substrings made of only one repeating character).
   - `max_`: Initialized to `-1`. This will store the length of the longest special substring that appears at least 3 times.

2. **Outer Loop**:
   - Iterates through each starting index `i` of the substring (from `0` to `n-1`).

3. **Inner Loop**:
   - Iterates through each ending index `j` (from `i` to `n-1`), generating substrings from `s[i:j + 1]`.

4. **Substring Extraction**:
   - `substring = s[i:j + 1]` captures a substring from `i` to `j` (inclusive).

5. **Check for Special Substring**:
   - `unique = set(substring)`: Converts the substring into a set of unique characters.
   - `len(unique) == 1`: Ensures the substring consists of only one unique character (i.e., it's a special substring).

6. **Update Frequency in Dictionary**:
   - `map_[substring] = map_.get(substring, 0) + 1`: Increments the count of the substring in the dictionary.

7. **Find Longest Special Substring**:
   - Iterate through `map_.items()`, which contains all substrings and their counts.
   - Check if the substring occurs at least 3 times (`values >= 3`).

8. **Track Maximum Length**:
   - Update `max_` with the length of the substring if it occurs at least 3 times: `max_ = max(max_, len(keys))`.

9. **Return the Result**:
   - If no special substring occurs 3 times, `max_` remains `-1`; otherwise, return the longest length found.

10. **Complexity**:
    - **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^3)\) due to nested loops generating all possible substrings and checking their uniqueness.
    - **Space Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\) because of the dictionary storing all possible substrings.

### **Working Example**

#### **Input:**
```plaintext
s = "aaabaaa"
```

#### **Step-by-Step Execution:**

1. **Substrings and Frequencies**:
   - `"a"` → appears 6 times
   - `"aa"` → appears 3 times
   - `"aaa"` → appears 2 times
   - `"b"` → appears 1 time

2. **Dictionary (`map_`)**:
   ```python
   {
       "a": 6,
       "aa": 3,
       "aaa": 2,
       "b": 1
   }
   ```

3. **Finding the Longest Special Substring Occurring at Least 3 Times**:
   - `"a"` appears 6 times (length 1).
   - `"aa"` appears 3 times (length 2).

4. **Result**:
   - The longest substring with at least 3 occurrences is `"aa"` (length 2).

#### **Output:**
```plaintext
2
```
