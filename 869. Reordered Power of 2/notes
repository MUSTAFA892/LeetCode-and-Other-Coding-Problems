## **Purpose of the Code**

The goal is to check whether **any permutation** of the digits of a given number `n` can form a power of 2.

For example:

* `n = 128` → permutations include `"128"`, `"281"`, `"812"`, etc.
* `128` itself is a power of 2 → return `True`.

---

## **Code Notes**

### 1. Importing permutations

```python
from itertools import permutations as p
```

* This lets you easily get **all possible rearrangements** of the digits of `n`.

---

### 2. Generating permutations

```python
for i in p(str(n)):
    permut.append(''.join(i))
```

* Convert `n` to a string so `p()` works with each digit separately.
* `p(str(n))` returns tuples like `('1','2','8')`.
* `''.join(i)` makes them into a full string like `"128"`.
* Store them all in the `permut` list.

---

### 3. Checking each permutation

```python
for i in permut:
    if i[0] == '0':
        start_zero = True
```

* If the first digit is `0`, skip it later (to avoid numbers like `"012"` being considered valid).

---

### 4. Testing if the permutation is a power of 2

```python
temp_var = int(i)
while temp_var % 2 == 0:
    temp_var /= 2
```

* Keep dividing by 2 until it’s no longer divisible by 2.
* If it **ends up as 1**, then it was a power of 2.

---

### 5. Final check

```python
if temp_var == 1 and not start_zero:
    return True
```

* If it’s a power of 2 **and** doesn’t start with zero → return `True`.

---

### 6. Resetting flag

```python
else:
    start_zero = False
```

* Reset `start_zero` before the next loop iteration.

---

## **Step-by-Step Example**

### Input:

```python
n = 128
```

---

### Step 1 – Permutations:

```python
['128', '182', '218', '281', '812', '821']
```

---

### Step 2 – Check each permutation:

#### **1st permutation:** `"128"`

* Does not start with zero.
* Convert to int → `128`
* Divide by 2:

```
128 → 64 → 32 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1
```

* Reaches `1` → valid power of 2 → return `True`.

---

If no permutation worked, the loop would finish and `return False`.

---

## **Potential Improvements**

1. **Avoid duplicate permutations** — e.g. numbers like `112` will repeat permutations unnecessarily.
2. **Avoid floating-point division**:

```python
temp_var //= 2
```

instead of

```python
temp_var /= 2
```

3. Precompute all powers of 2 within a reasonable range and just compare sorted digit strings (faster).
