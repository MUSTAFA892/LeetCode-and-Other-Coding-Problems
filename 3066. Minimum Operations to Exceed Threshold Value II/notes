### 1. **Function Definition:**
```python
def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
```
- The function `minOperations` takes two parameters: a list of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. 
- The goal is to find the minimum number of operations to make every element in `nums` greater than or equal to `k`.

### 2. **Initializing Variables:**
```python
count = 0
flag = False
heapq.heapify(nums)
```
- `count` keeps track of the number of operations performed.
- `flag` is used to check if all numbers in `nums` are greater than or equal to `k`.
- `heapq.heapify(nums)` transforms the list `nums` into a min-heap, which allows efficient extraction of the smallest elements.

### 3. **Checking if All Elements are Already >= k:**
```python
if all(num >= k for num in nums):
    return 0
```
- This line checks if all elements in `nums` are already greater than or equal to `k`.
- If so, the function returns `0` immediately because no operation is needed.

### 4. **Main Loop (while len(nums) > 0):**
```python
while len(nums) > 0:
```
- This loop will continue as long as there are elements in `nums`.
- Each iteration attempts to apply an operation and reduce the problem size (i.e., make elements greater than or equal to `k`).

### 5. **Flag Reset and Element Extraction:**
```python
flag = False
x = heapq.heappop(nums)
y = heapq.heappop(nums)
```
- `flag` is reset to `False` at the start of each loop iteration.
- `x` and `y` are the two smallest elements extracted from `nums` using `heapq.heappop(nums)`. These are the elements we will manipulate.

### 6. **Combining the Two Smallest Elements:**
```python
new_value = min(x, y) * 2 + max(x, y)
heapq.heappush(nums, new_value)
```
- The two smallest elements `x` and `y` are combined to form a new value. The formula is:
  \[
  \text{new\_value} = \min(x, y) \times 2 + \max(x, y)
  \]
  - This operation "double" the smaller element and then add the larger one to it.
- The new value is pushed back into the heap (`heapq.heappush(nums, new_value)`).

### 7. **Incrementing the Operation Count:**
```python
count += 1
```
- After performing the operation, the operation count (`count`) is incremented by 1.

### 8. **Checking if All Elements are >= k:**
```python
for num in nums:
    if num >= k:
        flag = True
    else:
        flag = False
        break
```
- This loop checks if all the elements in the heap are greater than or equal to `k`. 
- If one of the elements is less than `k`, `flag` is set to `False`, and the loop breaks.

### 9. **Returning the Operation Count if All Elements are >= k:**
```python
if flag:
    return count
    break
```
- If all elements in the heap are greater than or equal to `k`, the function returns the `count` of operations performed.
- The `break` is unnecessary here, since returning will exit the function.

### 10. **Return Operation Count if the Loop Ends:**
```python
if not flag:
    return count
```
- If the loop ends without all elements being greater than or equal to `k`, the function returns the `count` of operations.

### Working Example:

Let's walk through an example with `nums = [1, 3, 2, 4]` and `k = 6`.

1. **Initial Input:**
   - `nums = [1, 3, 2, 4]`, `k = 6`
   - We heapify `nums`, so now `nums = [1, 3, 2, 4]` becomes a min-heap: `[1, 3, 2, 4]`.

2. **First Check (`all(num >= k)`):**
   - Check if all elements in `nums` are greater than or equal to `k` (6). They are not, so we proceed.

3. **First Operation:**
   - Extract the two smallest elements: `x = 1` and `y = 2`.
   - Compute `new_value = min(1, 2) * 2 + max(1, 2) = 1 * 2 + 2 = 4`.
   - Push `new_value = 4` back into the heap.
   - Now `nums = [3, 4, 4]`.
   - Increment the operation count: `count = 1`.

4. **Check if All Elements are >= k:**
   - Loop through `nums = [3, 4, 4]`, none of the elements are greater than or equal to `k` (6), so we continue to the next iteration.

5. **Second Operation:**
   - Extract the two smallest elements: `x = 3` and `y = 4`.
   - Compute `new_value = min(3, 4) * 2 + max(3, 4) = 3 * 2 + 4 = 10`.
   - Push `new_value = 10` back into the heap.
   - Now `nums = [4, 10]`.
   - Increment the operation count: `count = 2`.

6. **Check if All Elements are >= k:**
   - Loop through `nums = [4, 10]`, and check if all elements are greater than or equal to `k` (6).
   - `4 < 6`, so `flag = False` and we continue.

7. **Third Operation:**
   - Extract the two smallest elements: `x = 4` and `y = 10`.
   - Compute `new_value = min(4, 10) * 2 + max(4, 10) = 4 * 2 + 10 = 18`.
   - Push `new_value = 18` back into the heap.
   - Now `nums = [18]`.
   - Increment the operation count: `count = 3`.

8. **Final Check:**
   - Now `nums = [18]`, and `18 >= 6`.
   - All elements are greater than or equal to `k`, so we return the operation count: `count = 3`.

### Conclusion:
- The minimum number of operations to make every element in `nums` greater than or equal to `k` (6) is **3**.
