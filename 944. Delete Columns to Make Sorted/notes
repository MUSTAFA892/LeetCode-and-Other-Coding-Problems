# 🧩 High-Level Idea of the Code

* `count` → keeps track of **how many columns are deleted**
* Outer loop → moves **column by column**
* Inner loop → checks **vertical order (top → bottom)** in that column
* `ord()` → converts characters into ASCII values to compare alphabetically

---

# 🔍 Line-by-Line Explanation

---

## 🔹 `count = 0`

```python
count = 0
```

* Stores the **number of columns that are NOT sorted**
* This will be your final answer

---

## 🔹 Outer Loop — Column Traversal

```python
for i in range(len(strs[0])):
```

* `strs[0]` → first string
* `len(strs[0])` → number of columns
* `i` → **current column index**

📌 This means:

> “Check column 0, then column 1, then column 2, …”

---

## 🔹 Column Validity Check

```python
if len(strs[0]) > 1:
```

* This condition checks whether each string has **more than 1 character**
* In LeetCode, this condition is **always true**, but your logic is still valid

---

## 🔹 Inner Loop — Row Traversal (Top → Bottom)

```python
for j in range(1,len(strs)):
```

* `j` starts from `1` because:

  * You compare current row with the **previous row**
* You are checking:

  ```
  strs[j-1][i]  vs  strs[j][i]
  ```

---

## 🔹 Character Comparison

```python
if ord(strs[j-1][i]) <= ord(strs[j][i]):
    continue
```

* `ord()` converts letters into numbers:

  * `a = 97`, `b = 98`, `c = 99`, …
* This checks:

  > Is the current letter **not smaller** than the one above?

✔ If yes → column still sorted → keep checking
❌ If no → column is invalid

---

## 🔹 Column Deletion Logic

```python
else:
    count += 1
    break
```

* As soon as **one violation** is found:

  * Increase `count`
  * `break` stops checking this column
* No need to check further rows for this column

📌 This is **efficient and correct**

---

## 🔹 Return Result

```python
return count
```

* Final number of columns that must be deleted

---

# 🧪 Working Example (Step-by-Step)

### **Test Case**

```python
strs = ["abc", "bce", "cae"]
```

Grid:

```
a  b  c
b  c  e
c  a  e
```

---

## 🔹 Column 0 (`i = 0`)

Characters:

```
a
b
c
```

Comparisons:

* `a <= b` ✔
* `b <= c` ✔

✅ Column sorted → **not deleted**

---

## 🔹 Column 1 (`i = 1`)

Characters:

```
b
c
a
```

Comparisons:

* `b <= c` ✔
* `c <= a` ❌

🚫 Violation found
➡ `count = 1`
➡ Stop checking this column

---

## 🔹 Column 2 (`i = 2`)

Characters:

```
c
e
e
```

Comparisons:

* `c <= e` ✔
* `e <= e` ✔

✅ Column sorted → **not deleted**

---

## 🔹 Final Result

```python
return 1
```

✔ Output is correct

---

# 🧠 Key Observations (Exam Gold 💡)

* Columns are checked **independently**
* Only **one violation** is enough to delete a column
* `break` avoids unnecessary comparisons
* Rows are **never** compared horizontally
* Equal characters are allowed (`<=` not `<`)

---

# 🔑 One-Line Mental Summary

> “For each column, if any letter goes backward when moving downward, delete that column.”
