## üîç Step-by-Step Explanation

### üß© Step 1 ‚Äî Identify Zeros

```python
zeros = []
for i in range(len(nums)):
    if nums[i] == 0:
        zeros.append(i)
```

* You loop through the array to **find all indices where `nums[i] == 0`**.
* These positions are the *starting points* where you‚Äôll ‚Äústimulate‚Äù from both directions (left and right).
* Example:
  `nums = [1, 0, 1]` ‚Üí `zeros = [1]` (since index `1` is `0`)

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2 ‚Äî The Stimulate Function

```python
def stimulate(zero_index, way):
```

This function simulates the ‚Äúmovement‚Äù starting from a zero in a chosen direction (either left or right).

#### Key variables:

| Variable    | Meaning                                                                     |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `temp`      | A copy of `nums`, to safely modify values                                   |
| `direction` | Current movement direction (`+1` = right, `-1` = left)                      |
| `pointer`   | Current position in the array                                               |
| `total`     | Keeps track of total sum of all numbers (to know when everything becomes 0) |
| `count`     | Used to count how many times all elements became 0                          |

---

### üîÑ Step 3 ‚Äî Simulation Logic

```python
while 0 <= pointer < len(nums) and total >= 0:
    if temp[pointer] != 0:
        temp[pointer] -= 1
        direction *= -1
        total -= 1
    pointer += direction

    if total == 0:
        count += 1
        break
```

#### Here‚Äôs what happens:

1. You start at a `zero` position.
2. You **move in the given direction (`way`)**.
3. Every time you find a **non-zero** element:

   * Subtract 1 (like consuming 1 unit).
   * **Flip the direction** (like bouncing back).
   * Reduce `total` by 1.
4. Keep going until:

   * You go out of bounds (`pointer` < 0 or ‚â• len(nums)), or
   * The total sum becomes 0 (everything turned zero).

---

### üîÅ Step 4 ‚Äî Try Both Directions for Each Zero

```python
for i in zeros:
    count += stimulate(i, 1)   # simulate going right first
    count += stimulate(i, -1)  # simulate going left first
```

Each zero may allow valid operations **in both directions**.
So for each zero:

* You test the rightward simulation.
* Then you test the leftward simulation.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 5 ‚Äî Return Final Count

```python
return count
```

After testing all zeros from both directions, you return how many valid cases resulted in the entire array becoming zero.

---

## üßÆ Working Example

Let‚Äôs dry-run your code on this:

```python
nums = [1, 0, 1]
```

### Step 1:

Zeros found ‚Üí `[1]`

### Step 2:

Start from index `1` (the zero):

* Try right (`way = 1`)
* Try left (`way = -1`)

---

#### Case 1 ‚Äî Stimulate Right (`way = 1`)

* `pointer = 1`, `direction = 1`, `temp = [1, 0, 1]`, `total = 2`

Now:

| Step | Pointer | Value | Action                | Direction | Total | Array     |
| ---- | ------- | ----- | --------------------- | --------- | ----- | --------- |
| 1    | 1       | 0     | skip (still 0)        | ‚Üí         | 2     | [1, 0, 1] |
| 2    | 2       | 1     | non-zero ‚Üí subtract 1 | flip (‚Üê)  | 1     | [1, 0, 0] |
| 3    | 1       | 0     | skip                  | ‚Üê         | 1     | [1, 0, 0] |
| 4    | 0       | 1     | non-zero ‚Üí subtract 1 | flip (‚Üí)  | 0     | [0, 0, 0] |

‚úÖ All became 0 ‚Üí count = 1

---

#### Case 2 ‚Äî Stimulate Left (`way = -1`)

* Similar logic, works the same due to symmetry.
  ‚úÖ Again all become 0 ‚Üí count = 1

---

üßæ Final total:
`count = 2`

---

## üß† Summary Note (for revision)

### üß© Problem Idea:

You are given an array `nums`.
Each time you start at a zero, you can move left or right.
Whenever you encounter a non-zero number, you:

* Decrease it by 1,
* Reverse your direction, and
* Continue moving.
  Count how many times you can make **all elements become zero** by starting at any zero (and in either direction).

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Points:

* Start simulation from every zero position.
* Try both directions (right `+1`, left `-1`).
* Keep flipping direction whenever a non-zero is reduced.
* Stop when:

  * You move out of bounds, or
  * The total sum of elements becomes zero.
* Count successful cases.

---

### üí° Complexity:

* Time Complexity: `O(n * z)` where `z` = number of zeros
* Space Complexity: `O(n)` due to array copy

| ----------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `[1, 0, 1]`                   | `2`    | Both directions from the zero lead to all zeros |
| `[0, 1, 2]`                   | `1`    | Only right direction works                      |
| `[16,13,10,0,0,0,10,6,7,8,7]` | `3`    | Only some zeros can clear the array             |
