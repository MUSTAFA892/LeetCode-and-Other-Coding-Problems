## High-level summary of what the code does

1. **Break `nums` into strictly increasing runs**. For each run we store:

   * `arr` — the run lengths (list of integers).
   * `index_` — the indices of elements in each run (list of lists of indices).
2. **Check adjacent runs**: for every pair of consecutive runs that are adjacent in the array, compute `min(len(run1), len(run2))` and track the maximum of those minima.
3. **Check inside each single run**: a single long increasing run can be split into two adjacent increasing subarrays; the maximum `k` available inside a run of length `L` is `L // 2`. Update the global maximum with these values.
4. Return the overall `max_k`.

## Step-by-step run for `nums = [1,2,3,4,4,4,4,5,6,7]`

### Initialization

* `arr = []`
* `index_ = []`
* `n = 10`
* `curr_idx = [0]`  (we start a run at index 0)

---

### First `for` loop: build runs (`for i in range(1, len(nums))`)

We iterate `i` from 1 to 9 and either append `i` to the current run (if `nums[i] > nums[i-1]`) or close the current run and start a new one.

I’ll list the state after each `i`:

* **i = 1**: `nums[1]=2 > nums[0]=1` → extend current run
  `curr_idx = [0, 1]`
  (`arr` and `index_` unchanged)

* **i = 2**: `3 > 2` → extend
  `curr_idx = [0, 1, 2]`

* **i = 3**: `4 > 3` → extend
  `curr_idx = [0, 1, 2, 3]`

* **i = 4**: `nums[4]=4` and `nums[3]=4` → NOT greater → **breaking point**

  * close current run:

    * `arr.append(len(curr_idx))` → `arr.append(4)` → `arr = [4]`
    * `index_.append(curr_idx.copy())` → `index_ = [[0,1,2,3]]`
  * start new run at index 4:

    * `curr_idx = [4]`

* **i = 5**: `nums[5]=4` ≤ `nums[4]=4` → break again

  * close run `[4]`:

    * `arr.append(1)` → `arr = [4, 1]`
    * `index_.append([4])` → `index_ = [[0,1,2,3], [4]]`
  * start new run: `curr_idx = [5]`

* **i = 6**: `nums[6]=4` ≤ `nums[5]=4` → break again

  * close run `[5]`:

    * `arr.append(1)` → `arr = [4, 1, 1]`
    * `index_.append([5])` → `index_ = [[0,1,2,3], [4], [5]]`
  * start new run: `curr_idx = [6]`

* **i = 7**: `nums[7]=5 > nums[6]=4` → extend

  * `curr_idx = [6, 7]`

* **i = 8**: `nums[8]=6 > nums[7]=5` → extend

  * `curr_idx = [6, 7, 8]`

* **i = 9**: `nums[9]=7 > nums[8]=6` → extend

  * `curr_idx = [6, 7, 8, 9]`

**After loop finishes** we append the last run:

* `arr.append(len(curr_idx))` → `arr.append(4)` → `arr = [4, 1, 1, 4]`
* `index_.append(curr_idx.copy())` → `index_ = [[0,1,2,3], [4], [5], [6,7,8,9]]`

**So the runs are:**

1. indices `[0,1,2,3]` → values `[1,2,3,4]` → length 4
2. indices `[4]` → values `[4]` → length 1
3. indices `[5]` → values `[4]` → length 1
4. indices `[6,7,8,9]` → values `[4,5,6,7]` → length 4

### Second phase: find `max_k` from adjacent runs

We set `max_k = 0` and run:

```python
for i in range(1, len(index_)):
    if index_[i-1][-1] + 1 == index_[i][0]:
        max_k = max(max_k, min(len(index_[i-1]), len(index_[i])))
```

We iterate `i` from 1 to 3 (since there are 4 runs):

* **i = 1**:

  * `index_[0][-1] = 3`, `index_[1][0] = 4` → `3 + 1 == 4` → adjacent ✓
  * `min(len(index_[0]), len(index_[1])) = min(4,1) = 1`
  * `max_k = max(0, 1) = 1`

* **i = 2**:

  * `index_[1][-1] = 4`, `index_[2][0] = 5` → `4 + 1 == 5` → adjacent ✓
  * `min(1,1) = 1`
  * `max_k = max(1, 1) = 1`  (unchanged)

* **i = 3**:

  * `index_[2][-1] = 5`, `index_[3][0] = 6` → `5 + 1 == 6` → adjacent ✓
  * `min(1, 4) = 1`
  * `max_k = max(1, 1) = 1`  (unchanged)

**After this loop**: `max_k = 1`.

> Note: this step only considers **pairs of distinct runs** where one run ends immediately before the next starts. For each such pair we can form two adjacent subarrays of length up to `min(length(run1), length(run2))`. Because the short singleton runs `[4]` and `[4]` are between the two long runs, the minima are 1.

---

### Third phase: check inside each single run (`for length in arr`)

```python
for length in arr:
    if length // 2 > max_k:
        max_k = length // 2
```

We iterate through `arr = [4, 1, 1, 4]`:

* `length = 4`: `4 // 2 = 2` → `2 > 1` → so `max_k = 2`
* `length = 1`: `1 // 2 = 0` → `0 > 2`? no
* `length = 1`: `0` → no
* `length = 4`: `2` → `2 > 2`? no

**After this loop**: `max_k = 2`.

This step captures the fact that the **fourth run** `[4,5,6,7]` (length 4) can be split internally into two adjacent increasing subarrays each of length 2 (for example `[4,5]` and `[6,7]`), so `k=2` is possible even though the runs surrounding it are short.

---

### Final result

* The function returns `max_k = 2`.

This matches the correct answer for that input.

---

## Why your earlier result was 1 (before you added the `length // 2` logic)

Originally you only compared **separate runs**. Because the long runs at the ends were separated by three single-element runs (`[4]`, `[4]`), the `min` across adjacent run pairs was 1 in every case — so the adjacent-run logic alone returned `1`. The `length // 2` check is necessary to capture adjacent subarrays **inside a single long run**, which is why adding it fixed that case.

---

## Complexity & notes

* **Time complexity:** O(n) to build runs + O(number_of_runs) to evaluate pairs and lengths → overall O(n).
* **Space complexity:** O(number_of_runs) for `arr` and `index_` (worst-case O(n) if the array alternates non-increasing/increasing).
* **Edge cases to be aware of:**

  * Entire array strictly increasing (single run): answer = `n // 2`.
  * No increasing pair at all (all equal or decreasing): answer = 0 (your code would return 0 because runs are of length 1 → `1 // 2 = 0`).
  * Multiple long runs with small separators: both checks (across runs and inside runs) are necessary.
