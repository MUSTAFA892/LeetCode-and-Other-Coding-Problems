### **1. Initialize a Set to Track Seen Numbers**  
- **Purpose**: We use a set called `result` to keep track of all the numbers we've encountered during the process. This helps in detecting cycles (i.e., when we revisit a number).
  
```python
result = set()
```

### **2. Loop Until `n` Becomes 1 or a Cycle is Detected**  
- **Purpose**: We continue the loop until `n` becomes `1`, which means the number is a happy number. If we encounter a previously seen number (i.e., a cycle), we know it's not a happy number.
  
```python
while n != 1:
```

### **3. Check for Cycle Detection**  
- **Purpose**: If `n` is already in the `result` set, it means we've encountered a cycle (i.e., the number is repeating), and we return `False` because the number is not a happy number.
  
```python
if n in result:
    return False
```

### **4. Add Current Number to the Set**  
- **Purpose**: After confirming that `n` hasn't been encountered before, we add it to the `result` set to keep track of the numbers we've seen in the current iteration.
  
```python
result.add(n)
```

### **5. Calculate the Sum of Squares of Digits**  
- **Purpose**: We calculate the sum of squares of the digits of the current number `n`. This is the core part of determining whether the number is happy or not. The digits of `n` are squared, and their sum is calculated.
  
```python
sum_squares = 0
for i in str(n):
    sum_squares += int(i) ** 2
```

### **6. Update `n` with the Sum of Squares**  
- **Purpose**: We update `n` with the sum of squares of its digits. This is the new number we will check in the next iteration.
  
```python
n = sum_squares
```

### **7. Return `True` if `n` Becomes 1**  
- **Purpose**: If the loop exits because `n` is equal to `1`, we return `True`, indicating that the number is a happy number.
  
```python
return True
```

### **Walkthrough Example with `n = 19`:**

1. **Initial Input: `n = 19`**
   - We start with `n = 19`. The set `result` is empty initially.
   - Since `n` is not in the set, we proceed.

2. **First Iteration:**
   - **Sum of squares of digits of `n = 19`**:
     - `1^2 + 9^2 = 1 + 81 = 82`
   - Update `n = 82`.
   - Add `19` to the `result` set.

3. **Second Iteration:**
   - **Sum of squares of digits of `n = 82`**:
     - `8^2 + 2^2 = 64 + 4 = 68`
   - Update `n = 68`.
   - Add `82` to the `result` set.

4. **Third Iteration:**
   - **Sum of squares of digits of `n = 68`**:
     - `6^2 + 8^2 = 36 + 64 = 100`
   - Update `n = 100`.
   - Add `68` to the `result` set.

5. **Fourth Iteration:**
   - **Sum of squares of digits of `n = 100`**:
     - `1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1`
   - Update `n = 1`.

6. **Loop Exits**:  
   - Since `n` becomes `1`, the function returns `True`, indicating that `19` is a happy number.

### **Explanation with 10 Key Points:**

1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing a set `result` to keep track of numbers we've seen. This is essential for cycle detection.

2. **While Loop**: We keep iterating while `n` is not equal to `1`. If `n` becomes `1`, we return `True`. If a cycle is detected, we return `False`.

3. **Cycle Detection**: Before performing any computation in each iteration, we check if `n` is already in `result`. If it is, that means we've entered a cycle, and the number is not happy.

4. **Adding to the Set**: Every time we process a new number, we add it to `result`. This helps us detect cycles in future iterations.

5. **Calculating Sum of Squares**: For each number `n`, we calculate the sum of the squares of its digits. This is the central operation that determines the "next" number in the sequence.

6. **Sum of Squares Loop**: The loop `for i in str(n)` converts the number `n` into a string, iterates over each digit, converts it back to an integer, squares it, and accumulates the result in `sum_squares`.

7. **Updating `n`**: Once the sum of squares is computed, we update `n` with this value. This is the new number we check in the next iteration.

8. **Exit Condition**: If `n` ever equals `1`, we know that the number is a happy number, so we return `True`.

9. **Handling Cycles**: If `n` repeats (i.e., is already in the `result` set), the number is not a happy number, and we return `False` immediately.

10. **Final Outcome**: The loop continues processing the sum of squares of digits until either a cycle is detected or `n` becomes `1`. If `n` reaches `1`, the function returns `True`, indicating a happy number.
