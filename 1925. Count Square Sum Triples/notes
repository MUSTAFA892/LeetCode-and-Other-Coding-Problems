### 🔍 What is this code doing?

The function `countTriples` is trying to count how many **Pythagorean triples** `(a, b, c)` exist where:
- \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \)
- All values are **positive integers** less than or equal to `n`.

It **does not require a < b < c**, so it includes all permutations of a and b.

---

### 🔁 Breakdown of the logic:

1. **Loop through all possible pairs (a, b)** from `1` to `n` inclusive.
2. Compute the sum of squares: `sum_ = a^2 + b^2`.
3. Compute the square root of the sum: `c = sqrt(sum_)`.
4. If `c` is an integer (`c * c == sum_`) and `c <= n`, then it's a valid triple.
5. Increase the count.

## 🧪 Example Walkthrough: `n = 5`

Let's try to find all valid triples for `n = 5`.

We loop over `a` and `b` from `1` to `5`.

We want to find all combinations where:
- \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \)
- `c <= 5`

---

### Let's try a few pairs manually:

#### (a=3, b=4)
- \( 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 \)
- \( \sqrt{25} = 5 \), which is an integer and ≤ 5
- ✅ Valid triple → count += 1

#### (a=4, b=3)
- \( 4^2 + 3^2 = 16 + 9 = 25 \)
- \( \sqrt{25} = 5 \)
- ✅ Valid again → count += 1

> So `(3,4,5)` and `(4,3,5)` both count as valid.

Are there more? Let's look at all valid `(a, b)`:

| a | b | a² + b² | sqrt     | c valid? |
|---|---|----------|----------|----------|
| 3 | 4 | 25       | 5        | ✅        |
| 4 | 3 | 25       | 5        | ✅        |

That’s it!

So the total `count = 2`.

---

## ✅ Final Output for `n = 5`:  
```python
s = Solution()
print(s.countTriples(5))
# Output: 2
```
