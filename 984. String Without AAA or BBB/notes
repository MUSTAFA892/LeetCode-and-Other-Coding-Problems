# Explanation 

## `s = []`

We build the answer as a list (faster for repeated appends).

---

## `while a > 0 or b > 0:`

Loop until **no letters left**.

---

## Case 1 — `a > b`

Meaning:

```
we have more 'a' than 'b'
```

So:

### `take = min(2, a)`

Take at most **2 'a' characters**

Prevents `"aaa"`.

### `s.extend('a' * take)`

Append them.

### `a -= take`

Reduce remaining count.

### If we still have `'b'` left:

Append **1 `'b'`**

This breaks large `'a'` groups.

---

## Case 2 — `a < b`

Mirror logic for `'b'`:

* place up to 2 `'b'`
* then 1 `'a'` (if any left)

Prevents `"bbb"`.

---

## Case 3 — `a == b`

Counts are balanced
so we safely alternate:

```
"ab"
```

Repeat until both reach zero.

---

## Finally

```
return ''.join(s)
```

Convert list → string.

# 🧪 Working Example Walkthrough

Let’s use:

```
a = 5
b = 3
```

Goal:

* 5 a’s
* 3 b’s
* no aaa/bbb

---

## Start

```
s = ""
a = 5
b = 3
```

---

## Loop 1

`a > b`

take = min(2,5) = 2

Add `"aa"`

```
s = "aa"
a = 3
```

Add `"b"`

```
s = "aab"
b = 2
```

---

## Loop 2

`a > b`

take = min(2,3) = 2

Add `"aa"`

```
s = "aabaa"
a = 1
```

Add `"b"`

```
s = "aabaab"
b = 1
```

---

## Loop 3

`a > b`

take = min(2,1) = 1

Add `"a"`

```
s = "aababa"
a = 0
```

Add `"b"`

```
s = "aababab"
b = 0
```

---

## End

```
a = 0
b = 0
loop stops
```

Final string:

```
"aababab"
```

### Check

* contains 5 a’s → ✔
* contains 3 b’s → ✔
* no aaa → ✔
* no bbb → ✔

Valid 👍

# 🟢 Another Example (reverse imbalance)

```
a = 2
b = 6
```

Expected pattern:

```
bbabbab
```
