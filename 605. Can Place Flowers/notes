1. **Input Parameters**:
   - `flowerbed`: A list of integers where `1` represents a planted flower, and `0` represents an empty plot.
   - `n`: The number of new flowers we need to plant.

2. **`flowers_planted = 0`**:
   - This variable keeps track of the number of flowers we have successfully planted.

3. **`for i in range(len(flowerbed))`**:
   - We iterate over each index of the flowerbed list to check whether we can plant a flower in the current position.

4. **`if flowerbed[i] == 0:`**:
   - We check if the current plot is empty (i.e., `flowerbed[i] == 0`). If it's not empty, we skip to the next plot.

5. **Left and Right Neighbor Check**:
   - **`left_empty = (i == 0 or flowerbed[i-1] == 0)`**:
     - If `i == 0`, we're at the first plot, and there is no left neighbor, so we treat it as "empty".
     - If `i > 0`, we check if the previous plot (`flowerbed[i-1]`) is empty (`0`).
   - **`right_empty = (i == len(flowerbed)-1 or flowerbed[i+1] == 0)`**:
     - If `i == len(flowerbed) - 1`, we're at the last plot, and there is no right neighbor, so we treat it as "empty".
     - If `i < len(flowerbed) - 1`, we check if the next plot (`flowerbed[i+1]`) is empty (`0`).

6. **`if left_empty and right_empty:`**:
   - If both left and right neighbors are empty (or out of bounds), we can plant a flower at `flowerbed[i]`.

7. **Plant the Flower**:
   - **`flowerbed[i] = 1`**: We plant the flower by setting the current plot to `1`.
   - **`flowers_planted += 1`**: Increment the count of planted flowers.

8. **Early Termination**:
   - **`if flowers_planted >= n:`**: If we have planted enough flowers (i.e., `flowers_planted >= n`), we return `True` immediately. There's no need to continue iterating.

9. **Return Statement**:
   - After finishing the loop, we return `True` if we managed to plant at least `n` flowers, and `False` otherwise.

10. **Final Output**:
   - The function returns `True` if it's possible to plant `n` flowers, and `False` if it is not.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Input 1:

**flowerbed** = `[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]`  
**n** = `1`

1. **Initial flowerbed**: `[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]`
   - We need to plant **1 flower**.

2. **Iteration**:
   - **At index 0**: `flowerbed[0] = 1` (occupied), so we skip.
   - **At index 1**: `flowerbed[1] = 0` (empty):
     - Left neighbor: `flowerbed[0] = 1` (not empty).
     - Right neighbor: `flowerbed[2] = 0` (empty).
     - **Can't plant a flower** here because the left neighbor is occupied.
   - **At index 2**: `flowerbed[2] = 0` (empty):
     - Left neighbor: `flowerbed[1] = 0` (empty).
     - Right neighbor: `flowerbed[3] = 0` (empty).
     - **Both neighbors are empty**, so we plant a flower.
     - The flowerbed becomes: `[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`.
     - We have planted `1` flower, which is exactly what we needed (`n = 1`), so we return `True`.

**Output**: `True`

#### Input 2:

**flowerbed** = `[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]`  
**n** = `2`

1. **Initial flowerbed**: `[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]`
   - We need to plant **2 flowers**.

2. **Iteration**:
   - **At index 0**: `flowerbed[0] = 1` (occupied), so we skip.
   - **At index 1**: `flowerbed[1] = 0` (empty):
     - Left neighbor: `flowerbed[0] = 1` (not empty).
     - Right neighbor: `flowerbed[2] = 0` (empty).
     - **Can't plant a flower** because the left neighbor is occupied.
   - **At index 2**: `flowerbed[2] = 0` (empty):
     - Left neighbor: `flowerbed[1] = 0` (empty).
     - Right neighbor: `flowerbed[3] = 0` (empty).
     - **Both neighbors are empty**, so we plant a flower.
     - The flowerbed becomes: `[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`.
     - We have planted `1` flower, but we need to plant one more.
   - **At index 3**: `flowerbed[3] = 0` (empty):
     - Left neighbor: `flowerbed[2] = 1` (occupied).
     - Right neighbor: `flowerbed[4] = 1` (occupied).
     - **Can't plant a flower** here because both neighbors are occupied.

3. **After the loop**: We haven't planted the required `2` flowers, so we return `False`.

**Output**: `False`
