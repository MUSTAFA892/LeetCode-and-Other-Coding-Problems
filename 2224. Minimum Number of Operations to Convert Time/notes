1. **Convert Time to Minutes:**
   - `current_time` and `correct_time` are calculated by converting the `current` and `correct` time strings (formatted as "HH:MM") into total minutes.
     - Example: "02:30" → `2 * 60 + 30 = 150 minutes`.

2. **Calculate the Difference in Minutes:**
   - Find the difference between the `correct_time` and `current_time`:
     ```python
     diff = correct_time - current_time
     ```
     - Example: `150 (correct) - 120 (current) = 30 minutes`.

3. **Use Greedy Approach:**
   - The goal is to minimize the number of operations needed to match the `current_time` to the `correct_time`.
   - The allowed operations are increments of 60, 15, 5, and 1 minute(s).

4. **Iterate Over Operation Values:**
   - Iterate through the list `[60, 15, 5, 1]`:
     ```python
     for i in [60, 15, 5, 1]:
     ```
     - For each `i`, calculate how many times the operation can be applied:
       ```python
       count += diff // i
       ```
     - Update `diff` to the remaining difference after applying the operation:
       ```python
       diff %= i
       ```

5. **Greedy Works Optimally:**
   - This approach works because using the largest possible increment reduces the remaining difference the fastest.

6. **Count Tracks the Total Steps:**
   - `count` keeps track of how many operations were applied in total.

7. **Handle Edge Cases:**
   - If `current` and `correct` are the same, `diff` will be `0`, and the function will directly return `0`.

8. **Efficiency:**
   - The time complexity is `O(1)` since we iterate through a fixed list of four operations.

9. **Output the Total Steps:**
   - The final `count` is returned, representing the minimum number of operations needed.

10. **General Use Case:**
    - The function works for any valid time inputs in "HH:MM" format and efficiently calculates the result.

### **Working Example:**

#### Input:
```python
current = "02:30"
correct = "03:35"
```

#### Steps:
1. Convert `current` and `correct` to minutes:
   - `current_time = 2 * 60 + 30 = 150 minutes`
   - `correct_time = 3 * 60 + 35 = 215 minutes`

2. Calculate the difference:
   - `diff = 215 - 150 = 65 minutes`

3. Apply operations greedily:
   - Use `60`: `65 // 60 = 1` → Add 1 to `count`, `diff = 65 % 60 = 5`
   - Use `15`: `5 // 15 = 0` → Add 0 to `count`, `diff = 5 % 15 = 5`
   - Use `5`: `5 // 5 = 1` → Add 1 to `count`, `diff = 5 % 5 = 0`
   - Use `1`: `0 // 1 = 0` → Add 0 to `count`

4. Total `count = 1 (60 minutes) + 1 (5 minutes) = 2`.

#### Output:
```python
2
```
