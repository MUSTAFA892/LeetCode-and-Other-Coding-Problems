1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `missingNumber` takes a list `nums` as input and returns an integer. This list contains `n` numbers, which are a part of a sequence from `0` to `n`.

2. **Calculate the Length of the List**:
   - `n = len(nums)` calculates the length of the list `nums`. This gives us the total number of elements in the list (which is `n`), but the list is missing exactly one number in the range `0` to `n`.

3. **Expected Sum of the Sequence**:
   - `expected_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2` calculates the sum of the first `n` numbers, which is the sum of the sequence `0, 1, 2, ..., n`. This is done using the formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers: \(\text{Sum} = \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2}\).

4. **Sum of the Elements in the List**:
   - `Total_sum = sum(nums)` calculates the sum of all elements currently present in the list `nums`. This sum is missing one number, which is the number we're looking for.

5. **Find the Missing Number**:
   - `return expected_sum - Total_sum` computes the missing number by subtracting the `Total_sum` (sum of the numbers in the list) from the `expected_sum` (sum of numbers from `0` to `n`). The difference will be the number that is missing from the list.

### Example Walkthrough:

Let's go through an example where `nums = [3, 0, 1]`.

1. **Input**: `nums = [3, 0, 1]`
   - The list `nums` contains `n = 3` elements. The list should contain numbers from `0` to `3` but is missing the number `2`.

2. **Step 1**: Calculate the length of `nums`:
   - `n = len(nums) = 3`.

3. **Step 2**: Calculate the expected sum of the sequence from `0` to `3`:
   - `expected_sum = 3 * (3 + 1) // 2 = 3 * 4 // 2 = 6`.

4. **Step 3**: Calculate the total sum of the elements in `nums`:
   - `Total_sum = sum([3, 0, 1]) = 3 + 0 + 1 = 4`.

5. **Step 4**: Find the missing number:
   - `return expected_sum - Total_sum = 6 - 4 = 2`.

Thus, the missing number is `2`.

### Working Example:

**Example 1:**

- **Input**: `nums = [3, 0, 1]`
- **Expected Output**: `2`

**Explanation**:
- The sum of the sequence from `0` to `3` is `6`.
- The sum of the elements in the list is `4`.
- The missing number is `6 - 4 = 2`.

**Example 2:**

- **Input**: `nums = [0, 1]`
- **Expected Output**: `2`

**Explanation**:
- The sum of the sequence from `0` to `2` is `3`.
- The sum of the elements in the list is `1`.
- The missing number is `3 - 1 = 2`.

---

**Example 3:**

- **Input**: `nums = [0]`
- **Expected Output**: `1`

**Explanation**:
- The sum of the sequence from `0` to `1` is `1`.
- The sum of the elements in the list is `0`.
- The missing number is `1 - 0 = 1`.
