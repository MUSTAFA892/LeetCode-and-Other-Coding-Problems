1. **Function Purpose**:
   The function rearranges the input array `nums` into its lexicographically smallest form while ensuring that numbers grouped together satisfy the condition:  
   \( |a - b| \leq \text{limit} \).  

---

2. **Sorting the Input (`sorted(nums)`)**:
   Sorting helps group numbers in a way that naturally creates smaller lexicographical order.

---

3. **Grouping with Condition**:
   - Groups are represented as deques (`deque`), and each group contains numbers with absolute differences ≤ `limit`.
   - If a number doesn't satisfy the condition with the last group, a **new group** is created.

---

4. **Mapping Group Indices (`num_groups`)**:
   - Each number is mapped to its **group index** in the `num_groups` dictionary, allowing quick access during the reconstruction phase.

---

5. **Deque for Efficient Operations**:
   - `deque` is used because it supports **efficient popping** from the front (\(O(1)\)), which is crucial during the reconstruction phase.

---

6. **Reconstruction of Original Order**:
   - For each number in the original `nums` array:
     1. Find the group it belongs to using `num_groups`.
     2. Take the **smallest available number** from the corresponding group (using `popleft()`).
     3. Add it to the result array (`res`).

---

7. **Lexicographical Order Guarantee**:
   - Since groups are built from the sorted array, the smallest numbers are always taken first when reconstructing, ensuring the output is lexicographically smallest.

---

8. **Output**:
   - The result array, `res`, is returned, maintaining the smallest lexicographical order while adhering to the grouping rule.

---

9. **Complexity**:
   - **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \log n)\) (due to sorting) + \(O(n)\) (grouping and reconstruction) = \(O(n \log n)\).
   - **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) for groups and mappings.

---

10. **Example with Visual Diagram**:

#### Input:
- `nums = [1, 5, 3, 9, 8]`
- `limit = 2`

---

### **Step 1: Sort `nums`**
```plaintext
sorted(nums) = [1, 3, 5, 8, 9]
```

---

### **Step 2: Group Formation**
Process each number from the sorted array:

| **Number** | **Condition**                   | **Action**                                                                 | **Groups**                |
|------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `1`        | Groups empty                    | Create new group                                                          | `[[1]]`                   |
| `3`        | `|3 - 1| = 2 ≤ limit`           | Add to last group                                                         | `[[1, 3]]`                |
| `5`        | `|5 - 3| = 2 ≤ limit`           | Add to last group                                                         | `[[1, 3, 5]]`             |
| `8`        | `|8 - 5| = 3 > limit`           | Create new group                                                          | `[[1, 3, 5], [8]]`        |
| `9`        | `|9 - 8| = 1 ≤ limit`           | Add to last group                                                         | `[[1, 3, 5], [8, 9]]`     |

---

### **Step 3: Map Numbers to Groups**
Map each number to its **group index**:
```plaintext
num_groups = {1: 0, 3: 0, 5: 0, 8: 1, 9: 1}
```

---

### **Step 4: Reconstruct the Array**
Using the original order of `nums` and `num_groups`, pop numbers from the groups:

| **Original `nums`** | **Group Index** | **Popped Number** | **Result** | **Updated Groups**    |
|----------------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------|-----------------------|
| `1`                 | `0`             | `1`               | `[1]`      | `[[3, 5], [8, 9]]`    |
| `5`                 | `0`             | `3`               | `[1, 3]`   | `[[5], [8, 9]]`       |
| `3`                 | `0`             | `5`               | `[1, 3, 5]`| `[[], [8, 9]]`        |
| `9`                 | `1`             | `8`               | `[1, 3, 5, 8]` | `[[], [9]]`      |
| `8`                 | `1`             | `9`               | `[1, 3, 5, 8, 9]` | `[[], []]` |

---

### **Final Output**:
```plaintext
res = [1, 3, 5, 8, 9]
```

---

### Visual Diagram of Deques (Groups):
- After grouping:
```plaintext
Group 0: [1, 3, 5] (Deque 0)
Group 1: [8, 9] (Deque 1)
```

- Reconstruction:
```plaintext
Deque 0 (Group 0): [1, 3, 5] → [3, 5] → [5] → []
Deque 1 (Group 1): [8, 9] → [9] → []
```
