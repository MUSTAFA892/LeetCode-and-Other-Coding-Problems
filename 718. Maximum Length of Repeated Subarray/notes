### **Virtual Idea / Intuition**:

1. **DP Table Representation**: 
   - Imagine a table where each row corresponds to an index in `nums1`, and each column corresponds to an index in `nums2`. So, if we have `nums1` of size `m` and `nums2` of size `n`, the DP table has dimensions `(m+1) x (n+1)`.
   - The cell `dp[i][j]` represents the **length of the longest common subarray** that ends at `nums1[i-1]` and `nums2[j-1]`.

2. **Base Case**:
   - We initialize `dp[0][*]` and `dp[*][0]` as `0`. This is because if either array is empty, there can't be any common subarrays. Hence, the longest common subarray ending at any index when one array is empty is `0`.

3. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - For each pair of indices `(i, j)` in the two arrays:
     - If `nums1[i-1] == nums2[j-1]`, it means these two elements match, so we can extend a common subarray that ends at `nums1[i-2]` and `nums2[j-2]`. The value of `dp[i][j]` will be `dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`.
     - If `nums1[i-1] != nums2[j-1]`, then there's no common subarray that ends at these two positions, so we set `dp[i][j] = 0`.

4. **Tracking Maximum Length**:
   - As you fill the DP table, you continuously track the **maximum length of any common subarray** you find in the table with the `max_` variable. This is the key to solving the problem.

### **How the DP Table Evolves**:
Let’s consider the input example:
- `nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`
- `nums2 = [3, 2, 1, 4, 7]`

#### DP Table Initialization:
We initialize a table `dp` of size `(m+1) x (n+1)` filled with zeros:

| `dp[i][j]` | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|-------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0           | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1           | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 2           | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 3           | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 4           | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 5           | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

#### Iteration Over `nums1` and `nums2`:

- At each pair of indices `(i, j)`, if `nums1[i-1] == nums2[j-1]`, then we update `dp[i][j]` to `dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`.

Let’s see what happens during each iteration:

#### For `i = 1`, `nums1[0] = 1`:
- `j = 1`, `nums2[0] = 3`: They don't match, so `dp[1][1] = 0`.
- `j = 2`, `nums2[1] = 2`: They don't match, so `dp[1][2] = 0`.
- `j = 3`, `nums2[2] = 1`: They match, so `dp[1][3] = dp[0][2] + 1 = 1`. Update `max_ = 1`.
- The rest of the cells will remain `0`.

#### For `i = 2`, `nums1[1] = 2`:
- `j = 1`, `nums2[0] = 3`: They don't match, so `dp[2][1] = 0`.
- `j = 2`, `nums2[1] = 2`: They match, so `dp[2][2] = dp[1][1] + 1 = 1`.
- `j = 3`, `nums2[2] = 1`: They don't match, so `dp[2][3] = 0`.
- The rest of the cells will be `0`.

#### Continue this for all `i` and `j`:

Eventually, you fill in the entire DP table, and the **longest common subarray length** will be stored in `max_`.

### **Final DP Table Example**:

| `dp[i][j]` | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|-------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0           | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1           | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 2           | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 3           | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 4           | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 5           | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

#### Final `max_`:
After iterating through the entire table, you find the longest subarray that is common to both `nums1` and `nums2`. In this case, the longest common subarray is `[3, 2, 1]` (length 3).
