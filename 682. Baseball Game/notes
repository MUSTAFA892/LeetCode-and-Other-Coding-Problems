Certainly! Here's a more detailed explanation with examples for each part of the code:

1. **Initialize `record` list:**
   ```python
   record = []
   ```
   - **Explanation:** This line initializes an empty list called `record` to keep track of the scores as they are calculated.
   - **Example:** At the beginning, `record = []`.

2. **Loop through `operations`:**
   ```python
   for i in operations:
   ```
   - **Explanation:** This starts a loop that goes through each element in the `operations` list, processing each one in order.
   - **Example:** If `operations = ["5", "-2", "4", "C", "D", "9", "+", "+"]`, the loop will first process `"5"`, then `"-2"`, and so on.

3. **Check if `i` is a number:**
   ```python
   if i.isdigit() or (i.startswith('-') and i[1:].isdigit()):
   ```
   - **Explanation:** This condition checks if the current operation `i` is a valid integer (either positive or negative). If true, it's treated as a score to be added to `record`.
   - **Example:** `"5"` and `"-2"` are recognized as numbers.

4. **Convert and add to `record`:**
   ```python
   record.append(int(i))
   ```
   - **Explanation:** Converts the string `i` to an integer and appends it to the `record` list.
   - **Example:** For `i = "5"`, `record.append(5)` results in `record = [5]`.

5. **Handle 'C' operation:**
   ```python
   elif i == 'C':
       record.pop()
   ```
   - **Explanation:** If the operation is 'C', remove the last score from the `record` list, effectively "canceling" the most recent round.
   - **Example:** If `record = [5, -2, 4]` and `i = "C"`, `record.pop()` changes `record` to `[5, -2]`.

6. **Handle 'D' operation:**
   ```python
   elif i == 'D':
       if record:
           record.append(2 * record[-1])
   ```
   - **Explanation:** If the operation is 'D', double the last score in `record` and append the result as a new score.
   - **Example:** If `record = [5, -2]` and `i = "D"`, `record.append(-4)` results in `record = [5, -2, -4]`.

7. **Handle '+' operation:**
   ```python
   elif i == '+':
       if len(record) >= 2:
           record.append(record[-2] + record[-1])
   ```
   - **Explanation:** If the operation is '+', sum the last two scores in `record` and append the result as a new score.
   - **Example:** If `record = [5, -2, -4, 9]` and `i = "+"`, `record.append(5)` results in `record = [5, -2, -4, 9, 5]`.

8. **Sum the `record`:**
   ```python
   return sum(record)
   ```
   - **Explanation:** Calculate the total score by summing all the values in the `record` list and return it as the final result.
   - **Example:** If `record = [5, -2, -4, 9, 5, 14]`, `sum(record)` returns `27`.

9. **Return the total score:**
   - **Explanation:** The final score, which is the sum of all the operations, is returned as the output of the function.
   - **Example:** For `operations = ["5", "-2", "4", "C", "D", "9", "+", "+"]`, the function returns `27`.

10. **Example Walkthrough:**
    - **Input:** `operations = ["5", "-2", "4", "C", "D", "9", "+", "+"]`
    - **Steps:**
      - `"5"` → `record = [5]`
      - `"-2"` → `record = [5, -2]`
      - `"4"` → `record = [5, -2, 4]`
      - `"C"` → `record = [5, -2]` (removes `4`)
      - `"D"` → `record = [5, -2, -4]` (doubles `-2`)
      - `"9"` → `record = [5, -2, -4, 9]`
      - `"+"` → `record = [5, -2, -4, 9, 5]` (adds `5` which is `-4 + 9`)
      - `"+"` → `record = [5, -2, -4, 9, 5, 14]` (adds `14` which is `9 + 5`)
    - **Final Sum:** `5 + (-2) + (-4) + 9 + 5 + 14 = 27`
    - **Output:** `27`
