# 📌 The Question (what are we trying to do?)

> Given a 2D grid of numbers,
> print out **every possible k × k sub-matrix (window)** inside it,
> starting from the largest k and shrinking it.

Here:

```
grid =
7 1 4 5 6
2 5 1 6 4
1 5 4 3 2
1 2 7 3 4
```

Rows = 4
Cols = 5
So the **largest possible square size = 4**

So the program prints:

* all **4×4** blocks first
* then all **3×3** blocks
* then all **2×2** blocks

(Stops before size = 1)

This is mainly for **visualizing windows** before checking magic-square logic.
