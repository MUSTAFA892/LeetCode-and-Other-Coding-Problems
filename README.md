 
# LeetCode and Other Coding Problems

This repository contains my solutions to a wide range of coding problems, including:

- ✅ LeetCode problems
- 🧠 Pattern printing challenges
- 📘 Logic puzzles and custom coding exercises
- 🧩 Data Structures & Algorithms practice questions

Each solution is written in a clean and understandable way, often accompanied by notes that explain the approach, algorithm, and any optimizations made.
