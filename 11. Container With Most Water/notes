1. **Problem Statement:**
   - You are given an array `height` where each element represents the height of a vertical line. The task is to find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container that can store the maximum amount of water. The area of the container is determined by the shorter line and the distance between the two lines.

2. **Two Pointer Approach:**
   - The solution uses the **two-pointer technique**, which is efficient for solving problems involving arrays and intervals. One pointer starts at the beginning of the array (`pointer_low`), and the other starts at the end of the array (`pointer_high`).

3. **Initial Setup:**
   - `pointer_low = 0` (starting from the left).
   - `pointer_high = len(height) - 1` (starting from the rightmost element).
   - `max_area = 0` to keep track of the maximum area encountered.

4. **Width Calculation:**
   - The width of the container is the difference between the two pointers: `width = pointer_high - pointer_low`.

5. **Height Determination:**
   - The height of the container is determined by the shorter line between `height[pointer_low]` and `height[pointer_high]`. This ensures that the water does not spill over the shorter line.

6. **Area Calculation:**
   - The area of the container is calculated as:  
     `area = min(height[pointer_low], height[pointer_high]) * width`.

7. **Updating the Maximum Area:**
   - The current `area` is compared with `max_area`, and `max_area` is updated if the current area is larger.

8. **Pointer Movement Logic:**
   - If `height[pointer_low] < height[pointer_high]`, increment `pointer_low` to move toward a potentially taller line on the left.
   - Otherwise, decrement `pointer_high` to move toward a potentially taller line on the right.

9. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs until `pointer_low` is less than `pointer_high`. This ensures all valid pairs of lines are considered.

10. **Result:**
    - After the loop finishes, `max_area` contains the largest area that can be formed by any two lines in the array.

### Full Working Example:

Consider the input:

```python
height = [1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7]
```

**Step-by-step Execution:**

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - `pointer_low = 0`, `pointer_high = 8` (last index), `max_area = 0`.

2. **First Iteration:**
   - `width = 8 - 0 = 8`
   - `area = min(1, 7) * 8 = 1 * 8 = 8`
   - `max_area = max(0, 8) = 8`
   - Since `height[0] < height[8]`, increment `pointer_low` to 1.

3. **Second Iteration:**
   - `pointer_low = 1`, `pointer_high = 8`
   - `width = 8 - 1 = 7`
   - `area = min(8, 7) * 7 = 7 * 7 = 49`
   - `max_area = max(8, 49) = 49`
   - Since `height[1] > height[8]`, decrement `pointer_high` to 7.

4. **Third Iteration:**
   - `pointer_low = 1`, `pointer_high = 7`
   - `width = 7 - 1 = 6`
   - `area = min(8, 3) * 6 = 3 * 6 = 18`
   - `max_area = max(49, 18) = 49`
   - Since `height[1] > height[7]`, decrement `pointer_high` to 6.

5. **Fourth Iteration:**
   - `pointer_low = 1`, `pointer_high = 6`
   - `width = 6 - 1 = 5`
   - `area = min(8, 8) * 5 = 8 * 5 = 40`
   - `max_area = max(49, 40) = 49`
   - Since `height[1] == height[6]`, decrement `pointer_high` to 5.

6. **Fifth Iteration:**
   - `pointer_low = 1`, `pointer_high = 5`
   - `width = 5 - 1 = 4`
   - `area = min(8, 4) * 4 = 4 * 4 = 16`
   - `max_area = max(49, 16) = 49`
   - Since `height[1] > height[5]`, decrement `pointer_high` to 4.

7. **Sixth Iteration:**
   - `pointer_low = 1`, `pointer_high = 4`
   - `width = 4 - 1 = 3`
   - `area = min(8, 5) * 3 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - `max_area = max(49, 15) = 49`
   - Since `height[1] > height[4]`, decrement `pointer_high` to 3.

8. **Seventh Iteration:**
   - `pointer_low = 1`, `pointer_high = 3`
   - `width = 3 - 1 = 2`
   - `area = min(8, 2) * 2 = 2 * 2 = 4`
   - `max_area = max(49, 4) = 49`
   - Since `height[1] > height[3]`, decrement `pointer_high` to 2.

9. **Eighth Iteration:**
   - `pointer_low = 1`, `pointer_high = 2`
   - `width = 2 - 1 = 1`
   - `area = min(8, 6) * 1 = 6 * 1 = 6`
   - `max_area = max(49, 6) = 49`
   - Since `height[1] < height[2]`, increment `pointer_low` to 2.

10. **Loop Exit:**
    - Now, `pointer_low = 2` and `pointer_high = 2`. The loop ends because the pointers meet.

**Final Answer:**
- The largest area is **49**, which is achieved between the lines at indices 1 and 8.
