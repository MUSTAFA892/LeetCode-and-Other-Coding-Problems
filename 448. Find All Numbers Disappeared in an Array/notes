1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `findDisappearedNumbers` takes a list `nums` as input, which contains numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with some numbers missing.
   - The goal is to find the list of numbers from 1 to `n` that are missing from `nums`.

2. **Convert `nums` to a Set**:
   - `a = set(nums)`: This converts `nums` into a set `a`. Sets have an average time complexity of O(1) for lookups, so this helps to quickly check if an element exists in `nums`.

3. **Initialize Result List**:
   - `result = []`: This initializes an empty list `result` to store the numbers that are missing from the list.

4. **Loop Through Numbers from 1 to `n`**:
   - `for i in range(1, len(nums) + 1)`: The function loops through all numbers from 1 to `n` (where `n` is the length of `nums`). This range represents the full set of numbers that should be in `nums`.

5. **Check for Missing Numbers**:
   - `if i not in a`: For each number `i` in the range, it checks if `i` is not present in the set `a`. If `i` is missing from the set `nums`, it is added to the `result` list.

6. **Return the Result**:
   - After looping through all numbers from 1 to `n`, the function returns the `result` list, which contains all the missing numbers.

7. **Time Complexity of `set` Lookup**:
   - Since the set lookup `if i not in a` takes O(1) time on average, the total time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of `nums`.

8. **Space Complexity**:
   - The space complexity is **O(n)** due to the creation of the set `a` and the `result` list, both of which can store up to `n` elements.

9. **Efficient Solution**:
   - This is an efficient solution because we only need to scan through `nums` once to create the set, and then we check the presence of each number in constant time.

10. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The code handles cases like when `nums` is already a complete list of numbers from 1 to `n` (i.e., no missing numbers) or when `nums` has many missing numbers.

### Working Example:

Let's walk through an example to better understand the behavior of the function.

#### Example:

```python
nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
sol = Solution()
print(sol.findDisappearedNumbers(nums))
```

1. **Input**:
   - `nums = [4, 3, 2, 7, 8, 2, 3, 1]`.

2. **Convert `nums` to a Set**:
   - `a = set(nums)` → `a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8}`. The set contains all unique numbers from `nums`.

3. **Loop Through Numbers from 1 to 8**:
   - The function loops through the numbers from `1` to `8` (since the length of `nums` is 8).

4. **Check for Missing Numbers**:
   - For `i = 1`: `1` is in the set, so it’s not added to the `result`.
   - For `i = 2`: `2` is in the set, so it’s not added to the `result`.
   - For `i = 3`: `3` is in the set, so it’s not added to the `result`.
   - For `i = 4`: `4` is in the set, so it’s not added to the `result`.
   - For `i = 5`: `5` is **not** in the set, so `5` is added to the `result`.
   - For `i = 6`: `6` is **not** in the set, so `6` is added to the `result`.
   - For `i = 7`: `7` is in the set, so it’s not added to the `result`.
   - For `i = 8`: `8` is in the set, so it’s not added to the `result`.

5. **Final Result**:
   - The missing numbers are `5` and `6`, so the `result` is `[5, 6]`.

### Final Output:

```python
[5, 6]
```
