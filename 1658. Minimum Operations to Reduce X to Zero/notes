1. **Function Purpose**:
   - The goal of the function is to find the minimum number of operations required to reduce the sum of elements in the `nums` array to exactly `x`. You can remove elements from either the left or right of the array.

2. **Initial Variables**:
   - `left = 0`: A left pointer, which will help in defining a subarray.
   - `sum_ = 0`: The current sum of elements in the window defined by `left` and `right`.
   - `max_operations = -1`: Tracks the longest subarray whose sum is `sum(nums) - x` (because that's the sum you need to remove to get the result `x`).
   - `target = sum(nums) - x`: This is the target sum of the subarray that should be left behind after removing the necessary elements.

3. **Base Case**:
   - If `target < 0`, it's impossible to reduce the sum to `x`, so we return `-1`.

4. **Main Logic - Sliding Window Approach**:
   - We loop through the `nums` array with the `right` pointer. At each step, we add `nums[right]` to `sum_`.
   - If `sum_ > target`, we shrink the window by moving the `left` pointer to the right, subtracting elements from the sum until `sum_ <= target`.
   - If `sum_ == target`, we have found a subarray whose sum is `target`. The length of this subarray is `right - left + 1`, and we update `max_operations`.

5. **Final Answer**:
   - If `max_operations == -1`, no valid subarray was found, so we return `-1`.
   - Otherwise, the result is `len(nums) - max_operations`, which represents the number of elements that must be removed.

6. **Time Complexity**:
   - The algorithm runs in O(n), where `n` is the length of `nums`, because both the `left` and `right` pointers traverse the array at most once.

7. **Sliding Window Insight**:
   - The approach uses the sliding window technique, where we maintain a subarray (or window) with a sum close to the target. We adjust the window size dynamically to find the best solution.

8. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `nums` is empty or if `target` is larger than the sum of the entire array, the result is `-1`.
   - If `x` equals the total sum of the array, the solution is to remove all elements.

9. **Efficiency**:
   - The sliding window approach ensures that we efficiently check all potential subarrays, avoiding the need for a nested loop.

10. **Result Calculation**:
    - After finding the subarray with the desired sum, the number of operations corresponds to how many elements we need to remove, which is calculated as `len(nums) - max_operations`.

### Example Walkthrough:

Letâ€™s walk through an example to demonstrate the function:

#### Example 1:
```python
nums = [1, 1, 4, 2, 3]
x = 5
```

**Step-by-step process:**

1. `sum(nums) = 1 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 3 = 11`
2. `target = sum(nums) - x = 11 - 5 = 6`
3. We now need to find a subarray with sum `6`.
4. Initially, `left = 0`, `right = 0`, and `sum_ = 0`.
   
   - **First iteration** (`right = 0`): `sum_ += nums[0] = 1`. Now `sum_ = 1`, which is less than `target` (6).
   - **Second iteration** (`right = 1`): `sum_ += nums[1] = 1`. Now `sum_ = 2`, which is still less than `target`.
   - **Third iteration** (`right = 2`): `sum_ += nums[2] = 4`. Now `sum_ = 6`, which is equal to `target`.
     - We found a valid subarray `[1, 1, 4]` (from index 0 to 2). The length of this subarray is `3`. We update `max_operations = 3`.
   - **Fourth iteration** (`right = 3`): `sum_ += nums[3] = 2`. Now `sum_ = 8`, which is greater than `target`.
     - We shrink the window by moving `left` to `1`, then `left` to `2`, and finally `left` to `3`. After adjusting `left`, `sum_ = 6` again, and we find another subarray `[4, 2]` with length `2`, but `max_operations` remains `3` as it's larger.
   - **Fifth iteration** (`right = 4`): `sum_ += nums[4] = 3`. Now `sum_ = 9`, which is greater than `target`, and we continue adjusting `left`.
   
5. Finally, `max_operations = 3`. The answer is `len(nums) - max_operations = 5 - 3 = 2`.

**Output**: `2`
