#### 1. **Bubble Sort Basics**
   - The bubble sort algorithm repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
   - This process continues until the list is sorted.

   **Example:**
   ```python
   nums = [2, 0, 1]
   sortColors(nums)
   ```
   After running bubble sort, the list will become:
   ```
   nums = [0, 1, 2]
   ```

#### 2. **In-place Modification**
   - Just like the `sort()` method, bubble sort modifies the list `nums` in-place and does not return a new list.
   
   **Example:**
   ```python
   nums = [1, 0, 2]
   sortColors(nums)
   ```
   After the function call:
   ```
   nums = [0, 1, 2]
   ```

#### 3. **Inner Loop for Adjacent Comparisons**
   - The inner loop iterates through the list and compares adjacent elements. If an element is greater than the next element, they are swapped.
   
   **Example:**
   ```python
   nums = [2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2]
   ```
   The bubble sort will compare and swap adjacent elements:
   ```
   nums = [0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2] -> [0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2] -> [0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2] -> [0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2]
   ```

#### 4. **Outer Loop for Multiple Passes**
   - The outer loop ensures that the sorting passes through the entire list multiple times, ensuring that the largest unsorted element "bubbles" to the correct position after each pass.

   **Example:**
   ```python
   nums = [2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2]
   sortColors(nums)
   ```
   After the first pass, the largest element `2` moves to the end. This process continues with each pass.

#### 5. **Time Complexity**
   - The time complexity of bubble sort is O(n²) in the worst case, where `n` is the number of elements in the list. This is because there are two nested loops that go through the list.

   **Example:**
   ```python
   nums = [2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2]
   ```
   Sorting takes O(n²) time for the 6 elements, which is 36 operations in the worst case.

#### 6. **Space Complexity**
   - The space complexity of bubble sort is O(1) because it sorts the list in place without using any extra space besides a few variables for swapping.

   **Example:**
   ```python
   nums = [0, 2, 1]
   sortColors(nums)
   ```
   No extra space is used besides the `nums` list itself.

#### 7. **No Need for Extra Data Structures**
   - Bubble sort does not require additional data structures (e.g., an auxiliary list) to sort the elements. It simply swaps elements in the original list.

   **Example:**
   ```python
   nums = [2, 1, 0]
   sortColors(nums)
   ```
   The sorting happens directly in the `nums` list without using any extra memory.

#### 8. **Works Well for Small Lists**
   - While bubble sort is inefficient for large lists, it may work fine for smaller lists with only a few elements. Since the problem is constrained to only three values (`0`, `1`, and `2`), bubble sort can still be acceptable for small lists.

   **Example:**
   ```python
   nums = [2, 0, 1]
   sortColors(nums)
   ```
   Sorting works fine even with only three elements.

#### 9. **Edge Cases**
   - **Already sorted list**: Bubble sort will still process through the list, but no swaps will happen.
   - **All elements are the same**: Bubble sort will still pass through the list, but no swaps will be needed.
   - **Single element**: There’s nothing to swap.

   **Examples:**
   - Already sorted:
     ```python
     nums = [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
     sortColors(nums)
     ```
     **Output**: `[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]`
   
   - All elements same:
     ```python
     nums = [2, 2, 2]
     sortColors(nums)
     ```
     **Output**: `[2, 2, 2]`

   - Single element:
     ```python
     nums = [1]
     sortColors(nums)
     ```
     **Output**: `[1]`

#### 10. **Alternative Sorting Methods**
   - Though bubble sort is a valid solution, in real-world scenarios, more efficient algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, or the built-in `sort()` method (which uses Timsort) are preferred for sorting large datasets.
   
   **Example:**
   - Using bubble sort for small datasets:
     ```python
     nums = [2, 0, 1]
     sortColors(nums)
     ```
     **Output**: `[0, 1, 2]`
