1. **Problem Context**:
   - The method `kthFactor` finds the `k`th smallest factor of a given number `n`.

2. **Input Parameters**:
   - `n`: The number whose factors are being searched.
   - `k`: The position of the factor you want to retrieve (1-based index).

3. **Factor List Initialization**:
   - An empty list, `factors`, is initialized to store all factors of `n`.

4. **Finding Factors**:
   - A `for` loop iterates over numbers from `1` to `n` to check which numbers divide `n` evenly (i.e., `n % i == 0`).
   - If `i` is a factor of `n`, it is added to the `factors` list.

5. **Checking Factor Count**:
   - After collecting all factors, the function checks whether the total number of factors is less than `k` using the condition `if len(factors) < k`.
   - If the list of factors contains fewer than `k` elements, it returns `-1`, indicating that the `k`th factor does not exist.

6. **Accessing the k-th Factor**:
   - If there are enough factors (i.e., `len(factors) >= k`), the method returns the `k`th factor.
   - Since list indexing is 0-based and `k` is 1-based, it returns `factors[k-1]`.

7. **Time Complexity**:
   - The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the input number. This is because the algorithm checks all numbers from `1` to `n` to find factors.

8. **Space Complexity**:
   - The space complexity is **O(d)**, where `d` is the number of divisors of `n`. In the worst case, the space used could be proportional to `n`.

9. **Edge Case Considerations**:
   - If `k` is greater than the total number of factors of `n`, the function returns `-1`.
   - If `k` is 1, it returns the smallest factor, which is always 1.

10. **Potential Optimizations**:
   - For larger values of `n`, the solution can be optimized by iterating only up to the square root of `n` and collecting both the divisor and its complement (`n // i`) simultaneously, reducing the time complexity to **O(sqrt(n))**.

### Working Example:

Let's walk through an example where `n = 12` and `k = 3`:

1. **Input**: `n = 12`, `k = 3`
2. **Finding Factors**:
   - Start with `factors = []`
   - Check for divisibility:
     - 1 divides 12 → `factors = [1]`
     - 2 divides 12 → `factors = [1, 2]`
     - 3 divides 12 → `factors = [1, 2, 3]`
     - 4 divides 12 → `factors = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
     - 5 does not divide 12 → no change
     - 6 divides 12 → `factors = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]`
     - 7 does not divide 12 → no change
     - 8 does not divide 12 → no change
     - 9 does not divide 12 → no change
     - 10 does not divide 12 → no change
     - 11 does not divide 12 → no change
     - 12 divides 12 → `factors = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]`
3. **Check if k-th Factor Exists**:
   - The total number of factors is 6 (`[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]`), and `k = 3`.
   - Since there are 6 factors, the 3rd factor exists.
4. **Return k-th Factor**:
   - The 3rd factor is `factors[3 - 1] = factors[2] = 3`.

**Output**: `3`

Thus, the function correctly returns `3` as the 3rd factor of `12`.
