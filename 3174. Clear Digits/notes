#### 1. **`while True:` loop**:
The `while True:` loop ensures that we continuously repeat the operation of removing the first digit and the character before it until there are no digits left in the string.

#### 2. **`for i in range(1, len(s)):` loop**:
The `for` loop iterates through the string starting from index `1` (since we need to access the character to the left of the digit). It checks each character to see if it’s a digit.

#### 3. **`if s[i].isnumeric():`**:
This checks whether the character at index `i` is a numeric character (i.e., a digit). If it is, we proceed to the next step to remove it and the character before it.

#### 4. **`s = s[:i-1] + s[i+1:]`**:
Once we find a digit, we remove it and the character before it:
- `s[:i-1]`: This gets the substring from the start of the string up to the character before the digit.
- `s[i+1:]`: This gets the substring from the character after the digit to the end of the string.
- We concatenate these two slices, effectively removing the digit and its preceding character.

#### 5. **`break`**:
Once a digit is found and removed, we `break` out of the `for` loop to restart the `while` loop. This ensures we start checking the string again with the updated version of `s`.

#### 6. **`else:`**:
If no digits are found (i.e., the `for` loop completes without executing the `if` condition), the `else` block is executed, which breaks out of the `while` loop. This indicates that there are no more digits left in the string, and we can stop the process.

#### 7. **Return Statement**:
Once the loop exits, the final string `s` (with all digits removed) is returned.

### Example Walkthrough:

Let's consider the string `s = "cb34"`.

#### Initial String:
```python
s = "cb34"
```

### Iteration 1:
1. **First iteration of the `for` loop**: We start from `i = 1` and check each character:
   - At index 2, we find the digit `'3'`.
2. **Removing digit and character before it**:
   - Remove `'b'` (at index 1) and `'3'` (at index 2).
   - The string becomes: `"c4"`.
   
3. **Restart the `while` loop**: Since there are still digits (`'4'`), we go through the process again.

### Iteration 2:
1. **Second iteration of the `for` loop**: We start from `i = 1` again and check each character:
   - At index 1, we find the digit `'4'`.
2. **Removing digit and character before it**:
   - Remove `'c'` (at index 0) and `'4'` (at index 1).
   - The string becomes: `""` (empty string).

Since no digits are left, the `else` block is triggered, and the `while` loop exits.

### Final Result:
```python
""  # Empty string
```

### Working Example:

```python
s = "cb34"
sol = Solution()
result = sol.clearDigits(s)
print(result)  # Output: ""
```

#### Step-by-step Output:

1. **First pass**: Remove `'b'` and `'3'` → `"c4"`.
2. **Second pass**: Remove `'c'` and `'4'` → `""`.

The final output is an empty string.
