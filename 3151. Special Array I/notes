#### Function Definition:
```python
class Solution:
    def isArraySpecial(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
```
- **`isArraySpecial`** is a method that takes a list of integers `nums` and returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`).
- The list `nums` represents the array for which we want to check if every adjacent pair of numbers has **different parity** (i.e., one is even and the other is odd).

#### Step 1: Getting the Length of the Array
```python
n = len(nums)
```
- **`n = len(nums)`**: We store the length of the array `nums` in the variable `n` for easier reference in the loop.

#### Step 2: Loop Through the Array:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
```
- We loop from index `1` to `n-1` because we are comparing adjacent elements in the array: `nums[i-1]` and `nums[i]`.

#### Step 3: Check Parity of Adjacent Elements
```python
if nums[i-1] % 2 == nums[i] % 2:
    return False
```
- **`nums[i-1] % 2 == nums[i] % 2`**: This checks if two consecutive elements `nums[i-1]` and `nums[i]` have the **same parity**. The `% 2` operation gives the remainder when divided by 2:
  - If both numbers are **even** (`num % 2 == 0`), or both are **odd** (`num % 2 == 1`), this condition will evaluate to `True`.
  - If they have the same parity, we return `False`, because the array is **not special**.

#### Step 4: Return `True` if No Adjacent Elements Have the Same Parity:
```python
return True
```
- If the loop completes and no adjacent pair with the same parity is found, we return `True`, indicating that the array is **special** (i.e., every adjacent pair has different parity).

### Key Points of Explanation:

1. **Input**:
   - Takes a list of integers `nums` and returns `True` or `False` depending on whether the array is "special".

2. **Array Length**:
   - We calculate the length of the array `n` to determine the bounds for the loop.

3. **Adjacent Elements Comparison**:
   - We compare every pair of adjacent elements (`nums[i-1]` and `nums[i]`) in the array to check if they have the **same parity**.

4. **Return False if Adjacent Elements Have the Same Parity**:
   - If any pair of adjacent elements have the same parity (both even or both odd), return `False`.

5. **Return True if All Pairs Have Different Parity**:
   - If the loop completes without finding a pair with the same parity, return `True`.

6. **Time Complexity**:
   - The loop runs `n-1` times (where `n` is the length of the array), so the time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the array.

### Example Walkthrough:

Let's walk through a specific example to understand the behavior of the function.

#### Example 1:

```python
nums = [4, 3, 1, 6]
```

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n = len(nums)` → `n = 4`
   
2. **Loop Iteration 1 (i = 1)**:
   - Compare `nums[0] = 4` (even) and `nums[1] = 3` (odd).
   - `4 % 2 != 3 % 2`, so they have different parity.
   - The loop continues.

3. **Loop Iteration 2 (i = 2)**:
   - Compare `nums[1] = 3` (odd) and `nums[2] = 1` (odd).
   - `3 % 2 == 1 % 2`, so they have the **same parity** (both odd).
   - Since they have the same parity, return `False`.

#### Final Output:
```python
False
```

This output means that the array is **not special** because the adjacent pair `(3, 1)` has the same parity (both are odd).

---

#### Example 2:

```python
nums = [4, 3, 2, 5]
```

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n = len(nums)` → `n = 4`

2. **Loop Iteration 1 (i = 1)**:
   - Compare `nums[0] = 4` (even) and `nums[1] = 3` (odd).
   - `4 % 2 != 3 % 2`, so they have different parity.
   - The loop continues.

3. **Loop Iteration 2 (i = 2)**:
   - Compare `nums[1] = 3` (odd) and `nums[2] = 2` (even).
   - `3 % 2 != 2 % 2`, so they have different parity.
   - The loop continues.

4. **Loop Iteration 3 (i = 3)**:
   - Compare `nums[2] = 2` (even) and `nums[3] = 5` (odd).
   - `2 % 2 != 5 % 2`, so they have different parity.
   - The loop completes.

Since no adjacent pair with the same parity was found, the function returns `True`.

#### Final Output:
```python
True
```

This output means that the array **is special** because all adjacent pairs have different parity.
