1. **Class Definition**: The class `Solution` is defined, following a common structure used in coding challenges (e.g., LeetCode).

2. **Method Definition**: Inside the class, the method `reverseString` is defined. It takes `s`, a list of characters (`List[str]`), as input.

3. **In-place Modification**: The method modifies the list `s` in-place, meaning it doesn't return a new list but alters the original list directly.

4. **Two-pointer Approach**: Two pointers, `left` and `right`, are initialized. 
   - `left` starts at the beginning of the list (`0`).
   - `right` starts at the end of the list (`len(s) - 1`).

5. **While Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `left < right`, meaning the two pointers move inward toward the center of the list, swapping elements along the way.

6. **Swapping Elements**: Inside the loop, the elements at positions `left` and `right` are swapped using the Python tuple swap: 
   ```python
   s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]
   ```

7. **Increment and Decrement**: After each swap:
   - `left` is incremented by 1 (`left += 1`), moving the pointer inward from the left.
   - `right` is decremented by 1 (`right -= 1`), moving the pointer inward from the right.

8. **List Fully Reversed**: When the loop completes, the list `s` is fully reversed in-place.

9. **Alternative Approach**: The comment section of the code mentions an alternative one-liner using Pythonâ€™s built-in `reverse()` method:
   ```python
   s.reverse()
   ```
   This method also reverses the list in-place.

10. **Return Value**: In both cases (two-pointer method and `s.reverse()`), the function doesn't return anything (`None`). The list `s` is modified in place, as per the problem requirement.

This implementation provides an efficient way to reverse a list of characters either manually (using two pointers) or with Python's built-in list method.
