#### **Explanation of the Approach:**

1. **Find the maximum element in the list:**
   ```python
   greater = max(nums)
   ```
   - The `max()` function is used to find the largest element in the `nums` list. This element is considered a "peak" since it is the largest value in the list.
   
2. **Return the index of the maximum element:**
   ```python
   return nums.index(greater)
   ```
   - After finding the largest element (`greater`), the `index()` method is used to find the index of this element in the `nums` list.
   - This index is returned as the position of the peak element.

#### **Example:**

Let's walk through an example to understand how the code works.

**Example Input:** `[1, 2, 3, 1]`

1. **Step 1:** Find the maximum element:
   - The maximum element in the list is `3`.
   
   ```python
   greater = max([1, 2, 3, 1])  # greater = 3
   ```

2. **Step 2:** Find the index of the maximum element:
   - The index of `3` in the list `[1, 2, 3, 1]` is `2`.

   ```python
   return [1, 2, 3, 1].index(3)  # Output = 2
   ```

**Output:** `2` (the index of the peak element `3`)
