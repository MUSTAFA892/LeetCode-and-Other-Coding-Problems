1. **Initialization of `dp`**:  
   The `dp` dictionary is initialized as a `defaultdict(int)` where the default value for any key is `0`.  
   The dictionary keeps track of the number of ways to achieve different sums at each step.  
   Initially, `dp[0] = 1` because there's exactly one way to achieve a sum of `0` — by selecting no numbers (the base case).

2. **Outer Loop** (`for i in range(len(nums))`):  
   The loop iterates through each number in the `nums` list. This is the main loop where we process each number and update possible sums accordingly.

3. **Inner Loop** (`for curr_sum, count in dp.items()`):  
   The inner loop iterates over each current sum (`curr_sum`) and the count of ways to achieve that sum (`count`) from the previous step.  
   - This is necessary because each number in `nums` can either be added (`+nums[i]`) or subtracted (`-nums[i]`).
   
4. **Next `dp` state** (`next_dp = defaultdict(int)`):  
   A new dictionary `next_dp` is created at the start of each outer loop iteration. This is where the new sums (after considering the current number) will be stored.
   
5. **Updating `next_dp` for Addition and Subtraction**:
   - For each sum in the current `dp`, two new sums are generated:
     - **`curr_sum + nums[i]`**: This represents adding the current number to the sum.
     - **`curr_sum - nums[i]`**: This represents subtracting the current number from the sum.
   - For each of these new sums, we increment their count in `next_dp` by the number of ways to get the original `curr_sum` (stored in `dp`).

6. **Transitioning to the Next State** (`dp = next_dp`):  
   After processing all possible sums for the current number, `dp` is updated to `next_dp`, which now holds the new possible sums.

7. **Final Answer** (`return dp[target]`):  
   After processing all numbers, the number of ways to achieve the target sum is stored in `dp[target]`. This value is returned.

8. **Time Complexity**:  
   - Let `n` be the length of `nums`.  
   - For each number in `nums`, we are iterating through all sums in `dp`. In the worst case, `dp` could hold sums from `-sum(nums)` to `sum(nums)`.  
   - Hence, the time complexity is approximately `O(n * 2^n)`.

9. **Space Complexity**:  
   - The space complexity is `O(2^n)` because `dp` stores sums that range from `-sum(nums)` to `sum(nums)`.

10. **Edge Case**:  
    - If `target` is `0`, then `dp[0]` will always be `1` at the start, meaning there is at least one way (by choosing no numbers) to achieve the sum.

### Working Example:

Let's go through a detailed example to illustrate how the algorithm works.

#### Example Input:
```python
nums = [1, 1, 1, 1]
target = 2
```

#### Initial Setup:

- **`dp`**: At the start, `dp = defaultdict(int)` with `dp[0] = 1`.  
  (This means there is one way to achieve a sum of `0` — by selecting no elements.)

#### First Iteration (`i = 0`, nums[i] = 1):

- **`dp`**: `{0: 1}`  
- Now, we need to consider the possible sums after adding or subtracting `1`.
  - For `curr_sum = 0`, we can create the sums:
    - `curr_sum + nums[i] = 0 + 1 = 1` → increment `next_dp[1]` by 1.
    - `curr_sum - nums[i] = 0 - 1 = -1` → increment `next_dp[-1]` by 1.

- **`next_dp`** after this iteration: `{1: 1, -1: 1}`  
- Update `dp` to `next_dp`: `dp = {1: 1, -1: 1}`.

#### Second Iteration (`i = 1`, nums[i] = 1):

- **`dp`**: `{1: 1, -1: 1}`  
- Now, we process the sums created in the previous iteration.
  - For `curr_sum = 1`, we can create the sums:
    - `curr_sum + nums[i] = 1 + 1 = 2` → increment `next_dp[2]` by 1.
    - `curr_sum - nums[i] = 1 - 1 = 0` → increment `next_dp[0]` by 1.
  - For `curr_sum = -1`, we can create the sums:
    - `curr_sum + nums[i] = -1 + 1 = 0` → increment `next_dp[0]` by 1.
    - `curr_sum - nums[i] = -1 - 1 = -2` → increment `next_dp[-2]` by 1.

- **`next_dp`** after this iteration: `{2: 1, 0: 2, -2: 1}`  
- Update `dp` to `next_dp`: `dp = {2: 1, 0: 2, -2: 1}`.

#### Third Iteration (`i = 2`, nums[i] = 1):

- **`dp`**: `{2: 1, 0: 2, -2: 1}`  
- Now, we process the sums created in the previous iteration.
  - For `curr_sum = 2`, we can create the sums:
    - `curr_sum + nums[i] = 2 + 1 = 3` → increment `next_dp[3]` by 1.
    - `curr_sum - nums[i] = 2 - 1 = 1` → increment `next_dp[1]` by 1.
  - For `curr_sum = 0`, we can create the sums:
    - `curr_sum + nums[i] = 0 + 1 = 1` → increment `next_dp[1]` by 2 (since `dp[0] = 2`).
    - `curr_sum - nums[i] = 0 - 1 = -1` → increment `next_dp[-1]` by 2.
  - For `curr_sum = -2`, we can create the sums:
    - `curr_sum + nums[i] = -2 + 1 = -1` → increment `next_dp[-1]` by 1.
    - `curr_sum - nums[i] = -2 - 1 = -3` → increment `next_dp[-3]` by 1.

- **`next_dp`** after this iteration: `{3: 1, 1: 3, -1: 3, -3: 1}`  
- Update `dp` to `next_dp`: `dp = {3: 1, 1: 3, -1: 3, -3: 1}`.

#### Fourth Iteration (`i = 3`, nums[i] = 1):

- **`dp`**: `{3: 1, 1: 3, -1: 3, -3: 1}`  
- Now, we process the sums created in the previous iteration.
  - For `curr_sum = 3`, we can create the sums:
    - `curr_sum + nums[i] = 3 + 1 = 4` → increment `next_dp[4]` by 1.
    - `curr_sum - nums[i] = 3 - 1 = 2` → increment `next_dp[2]` by 1.
  - For `curr_sum = 1`, we can create the sums:
    - `curr_sum + nums[i] = 1 + 1 = 2` → increment `next_dp[2]` by 3.
    - `curr_sum - nums[i] = 1 - 1 = 0` → increment `next_dp[0]` by 3.
  - For `curr_sum = -1`, we can create the sums:
    - `curr_sum + nums[i] = -1 + 1 = 0` → increment `next_dp[0]` by 3.
    - `curr_sum - nums[i] = -1 - 1 = -2` → increment `next_dp[-2]` by 3.
  - For `curr_sum = -3`, we can create the sums:
    - `curr_sum + nums[i] = -3 + 1 = -2` → increment `next_dp[-2]` by 1.
    - `curr_sum - nums[i] = -3 - 1 = -4` → increment `next_dp[-4]` by 1.

- **`next_dp`** after this iteration: `{4: 1, 2: 4, 0: 6, -2: 4, -4: 1}`  
- Update `dp` to `next_dp`: `dp = {4: 1, 2: 4, 0: 6, -2: 4, -4: 1}`.

#### Final Step:

- **`dp[target]`** is `dp[2]`, which is `4`.  
  This means there are 4 different ways to assign `+` and `-` to the elements of `nums` such that their sum equals the target `2`.

### Final Output:
```python
4
```
