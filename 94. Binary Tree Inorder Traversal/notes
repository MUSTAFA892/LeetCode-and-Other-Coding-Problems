1. **Recursive Approach for Tree Traversal**:
   - **Explanation**: The function uses recursion to perform an in-order traversal of the tree. In in-order traversal, we visit the left subtree, then the root, and finally the right subtree. This is a depth-first traversal.
   - **Why it's important**: Recursion is particularly useful for tree traversal because it allows you to process each node in a structured and systematic way.

2. **Base Case: Node is None**:
   - **Code**: `if node is None: return`
   - **Explanation**: This is the base case of the recursion. If the current node is `None` (i.e., if there are no more nodes to process in the current path), we simply return and end the recursion for that path.
   - **Why it's important**: This ensures that the recursion doesn't continue indefinitely and handles the case where we reach the end of a branch in the tree.

3. **Recursive Call for Left Subtree**:
   - **Code**: `in_order(node.left)`
   - **Explanation**: Before visiting the current node (root), we first recursively call the `in_order` function to traverse the left subtree.
   - **Why it's important**: This ensures that we visit all the nodes in the left subtree before processing the current node (root).

4. **Processing the Current Node (Root)**:
   - **Code**: `result.append(node.val)`
   - **Explanation**: After the left subtree has been processed, we add the value of the current node to the `result` list.
   - **Why it's important**: This is the core of the in-order traversal — we process the root node after its left child has been fully processed.

5. **Recursive Call for Right Subtree**:
   - **Code**: `in_order(node.right)`
   - **Explanation**: After processing the current node, we recursively call the `in_order` function to traverse the right subtree.
   - **Why it's important**: This ensures that we visit all the nodes in the right subtree after the current node.

6. **Result List**:
   - **Code**: `result = []`
   - **Explanation**: An empty list `result` is created to store the values of the nodes as they are visited during the traversal.
   - **Why it's important**: This list will hold the output of the traversal, which is the sequence of node values in in-order.

7. **Calling the Helper Function**:
   - **Code**: `in_order(root)`
   - **Explanation**: The helper function `in_order` is called with the root of the tree, initiating the traversal from the root.
   - **Why it's important**: This is where the recursion starts, and the tree traversal begins from the root node.

8. **Returning the Result**:
   - **Code**: `return result`
   - **Explanation**: After the recursion completes and all nodes have been visited, the function returns the `result` list, which contains the node values in in-order sequence.
   - **Why it's important**: This step provides the final result of the traversal.

### Time and Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the binary tree. We visit each node once.
- **Space Complexity**: **O(h)**, where `h` is the height of the tree. This is due to the space used by the recursion call stack (which is proportional to the height of the tree).

### Working Example:

Consider the following binary tree:

```
    1
   / \
  2   3
 /
4
```

1. **Call `in_order(root)`** with `root = TreeNode(1)`.
   
2. **Call `in_order(node.left)`** with `node = TreeNode(2)`:
   - **Call `in_order(node.left)`** with `node = TreeNode(4)`:
     - **Call `in_order(node.left)`** with `node = None` (base case: return).
     - Append `4` to `result`.
     - **Call `in_order(node.right)`** with `node = None` (base case: return).
   - Append `2` to `result`.
   - **Call `in_order(node.right)`** with `node = None` (base case: return).

3. Append `1` to `result`.

4. **Call `in_order(node.right)`** with `node = TreeNode(3)`:
   - **Call `in_order(node.left)`** with `node = None` (base case: return).
   - Append `3` to `result`.
   - **Call `in_order(node.right)`** with `node = None` (base case: return).

### Final Result:
After all recursive calls are completed, the `result` list will contain the values in in-order sequence:

```
[4, 2, 1, 3]
```

### Summary of Recursive Calls:
1. `in_order(root)` → Visit `1`
2. `in_order(node.left)` with `node = 2` → Visit `2`
   - `in_order(node.left)` with `node = 4` → Visit `4`
3. `in_order(node.right)` with `node = None` → Base case, return.
4. `in_order(node.right)` with `node = 3` → Visit `3`
5. Return `[4, 2, 1, 3]`

### Output:

```python
[4, 2, 1, 3]
```
