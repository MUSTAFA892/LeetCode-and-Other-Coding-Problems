### Example Input:
```python
nums = [0, 1, 2, 2, 4, 4, 1, 0]
```

### Step-by-Step Execution:

1. **Initial List**  
   The input list is:
   ```python
   nums = [0, 1, 2, 2, 4, 4, 1, 0]
   ```

2. **Filter Even Numbers**  
   The function first filters out all the even numbers from the list. This is done using list comprehension:
   ```python
   even_nums = [i for i in nums if i % 2 == 0]
   ```
   After filtering the even numbers, we get:
   ```python
   even_nums = [0, 2, 2, 4, 4, 0]
   ```
   Here, only the even numbers (`0`, `2`, `2`, `4`, `4`, `0`) are kept.

3. **Sort the Even Numbers**  
   The list of even numbers is then sorted:
   ```python
   even_nums.sort()
   ```
   After sorting, the list becomes:
   ```python
   even_nums = [0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 4]
   ```
   Sorting is done to ensure that in case of a tie in frequency, the smallest number is selected. So, we now have the sorted list of even numbers.

4. **Count the Frequency of Each Even Number**  
   Next, the function uses the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each even number in the list:
   ```python
   freq = Counter(even_nums)
   ```
   The resulting frequency dictionary is:
   ```python
   freq = {0: 2, 2: 2, 4: 2}
   ```
   This means:
   - `0` appears 2 times
   - `2` appears 2 times
   - `4` appears 2 times

5. **Check if there are Any Even Numbers**  
   The function checks if there are any even numbers in the list by checking if the frequency dictionary is not empty:
   ```python
   if freq:
   ```
   Since the frequency dictionary is not empty (it contains `{0: 2, 2: 2, 4: 2}`), the function proceeds to the next step.

6. **Find the Most Frequent Even Number**  
   Now, the function iterates over the frequency dictionary and compares the frequency of each number with the current `max_freq`. Initially, `max_freq` is set to 0, and `max_freq_value` is set to -1.
   
   The loop starts:
   ```python
   for value, count in freq.items():
   ```
   - First, it checks the number `0` with a frequency of `2`:
     - Since `2 > 0` (the current `max_freq`), it updates `max_freq` to `2` and `max_freq_value` to `0`.
     ```python
     max_freq = 2
     max_freq_value = 0
     ```
   
   - Next, it checks the number `2` with a frequency of `2`:
     - Since `2 == 2` (the current `max_freq`), there is a tie. Because the numbers are processed in sorted order, and `0` is already smaller than `2`, the current `max_freq_value` remains `0` (no update).
   
   - Then, it checks the number `4` with a frequency of `2`:
     - Again, since `2 == 2` (the current `max_freq`), there is another tie. The current `max_freq_value` remains `0`.

7. **Return the Result**  
   After processing all the numbers, the function returns the `max_freq_value`, which is the most frequent even number:
   ```python
   return max_freq_value
   ```
   In this case, the most frequent even number is `0`.

---

### Final Output:
```python
Output: 0
```

### Why the Output is `0`:
- The function first identifies all the even numbers: `[0, 2, 2, 4, 4, 0]`.
- It counts their frequencies: `{0: 2, 2: 2, 4: 2}`.
- Since all even numbers have the same frequency of `2`, the smallest number among them, `0`, is chosen and returned as the result.
