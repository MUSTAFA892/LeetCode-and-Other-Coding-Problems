### **Explanation**

1. **Initialization**

   * `drank = numBottles` → drink all starting bottles.
   * `empty = numBottles` → all bottles become empty.

2. **Loop condition**

   * `while empty >= numExchange:` → as long as you have **enough empties for one exchange**.

3. **Exchange logic**

   * `left_over = empty - numExchange` → the empty bottles left after trading **exactly one bottle**.
   * `drank += 1` → drink the new full bottle.
   * `empty = left_over + 1` → after drinking the new bottle, add 1 empty.
   * `numExchange += 1` → increase the exchange rate (Water Bottles II rule).

✅ This handles **one exchange at a time**, which is exactly what Water Bottles II requires.

## **Working Example**

Let’s use the tricky input:

`numBottles = 10, numExchange = 3`

---

**Step 0 (Start)**

* `drank = 10`
* `empty = 10`
* `numExchange = 3`

---

**Step 1**

* `empty (10) >= numExchange (3)` ✅
* `left_over = 10 - 3 = 7`
* `drank += 1 → 11`
* `empty = 7 + 1 = 8`
* `numExchange += 1 → 4`

---

**Step 2**

* `empty (8) >= numExchange (4)` ✅
* `left_over = 8 - 4 = 4`
* `drank += 1 → 12`
* `empty = 4 + 1 = 5`
* `numExchange += 1 → 5`

---

**Step 3**

* `empty (5) >= numExchange (5)` ✅
* `left_over = 5 - 5 = 0`
* `drank += 1 → 13`
* `empty = 0 + 1 = 1`
* `numExchange += 1 → 6`

---

**Step 4**

* `empty (1) >= numExchange (6)` ❌ → stop

---

### ✅ Final Result: `drank = 13`

This matches the **correct answer** for Water Bottles II.
