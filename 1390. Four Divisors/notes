# 📘 Problem

For each number in `nums`,
👉 find all its **divisors**
👉 if it has **exactly 4 divisors**, add their **sum**
👉 return the **total sum** over all numbers

---

# 🧠 Key Insight

A number usually has many divisors.
But we only care about numbers that have **exactly 4**.

Examples

```
6  → divisors = 1,2,3,6   (valid)
8  → divisors = 1,2,4,8   (valid)
7  → divisors = 1,7       (invalid)
4  → divisors = 1,2,4     (invalid)
```

# 📖 Explanation (Step-by-Step)

## 🔹 Outer function: `sumFourDivisors`

This loops through every number in `nums` and keeps a running total.

```
sum_ += divisor(i)
```

So the helper function `divisor()` returns:

* sum of divisors if the number has exactly 4 divisors
* 0 otherwise

---

## 🔹 Inner function: `divisor(num)`

### 1️⃣ Start with 2 known divisors

```python
arr = [1,num]
```

Because every positive integer has:

* 1
* itself

So we already have **2 divisors**.

---

### 2️⃣ Loop through possible divisors up to √num

```python
for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(num)) + 1):
```

Why up to √num?

👉 divisors come in pairs

Example for num = 21

```
3 × 7 = 21
```

So when we find `i = 3`,
we also know `num//i = 7`

This avoids checking all numbers up to num.

---

### 3️⃣ Check if `i` is a divisor

```python
if num % i == 0:
```

If yes:

* append `i`
* append its pair `num // i` (only if different)

```python
arr.append(i)
if num // i != i:
    arr.append(num // i)
```

This ensures perfect squares don’t double count
(e.g., `4 → 2 & 2` counts once)

---

### 4️⃣ Early Exit Optimization

```python
if len(arr) > 4:
    break
```

As soon as there are more than 4 divisors:
👉 we KNOW this number is invalid
👉 stop immediately

This prevents wasted time.

---

### 5️⃣ Final Check

```python
if len(arr) == 4:
    return sum(arr)
else:
    return 0
```

So only numbers with **exactly 4 divisors** contribute.

---

# 🧪 Working Example (Test Case)

Let:

```
nums = [21, 4, 7]
```

We’ll evaluate each number.

---

## ✅ Number 1: 21

Start:

```
arr = [1, 21]
```

Loop i from 2 → 4 (since √21 ≈ 4.5)

| i | 21 % i == 0 ? | Action    | arr        |
| - | ------------- | --------- | ---------- |
| 2 | No            | —         | [1,21]     |
| 3 | Yes           | add 3 & 7 | [1,21,3,7] |

Now:

```
len(arr) = 4
```

Loop continues but no more divisors found.

Final:

```
divisors = [1,3,7,21]
sum = 32
```

So function returns:

```
32
```

---

## ❌ Number 2: 4

Start:

```
arr = [1,4]
```

Loop i from 2 → 2 (√4 = 2)

| i | 4 % i == 0 ? | Action            | arr     |
| - | ------------ | ----------------- | ------- |
| 2 | Yes          | add 2 (pair same) | [1,4,2] |

Final:

```
divisors = [1,2,4]
len = 3  → invalid
returns 0
```

---

## ❌ Number 3: 7

Start:

```
arr = [1,7]
```

Loop i from 2 → 2 (√7 ≈ 2.64)

| i | 7 % i == 0 ? | Action |
| - | ------------ | ------ |
| 2 | No           | —      |

Final:

```
divisors = [1,7]
len = 2 → invalid
returns 0
```

---

# 🧮 Final Total

```
32 + 0 + 0 = 32
```

So the output is:

```
32
```
