### Code Explanation

1. **Sorting the Array**:
   ```python
   nums.sort()
   ```
   - The `sort()` method arranges the numbers in ascending order. This helps in maintaining the order when checking for square relationships.

2. **Creating a Set for Quick Look-Up**:
   ```python
   nums_set = set(nums)
   ```
   - By converting the list into a set, we enable O(1) average time complexity for membership checks. This allows us to quickly determine if a squared number exists in the original list.

3. **Initializing the Maximum Length**:
   ```python
   max_length = 0
   ```
   - This variable keeps track of the length of the longest valid square streak found during the iteration through the numbers.

4. **Iterating Through Each Number**:
   ```python
   for num in nums:
   ```
   - This loop goes through each number in the sorted array one by one.

5. **Starting the Current Length**:
   ```python
   current_length = 1
   ```
   - We initialize `current_length` to 1 because the streak starts with the current number itself.

6. **Setting Up for the Square Streak Check**:
   ```python
   current_number = num
   ```
   - We use `current_number` to track the number we're currently evaluating for potential streaks.

7. **Checking for the Square Streak**:
   ```python
   while current_number * current_number in nums_set:
       current_number = current_number * current_number
       current_length += 1
   ```
   - This while loop checks if the square of `current_number` exists in the set. If it does:
     - We update `current_number` to its square.
     - We increment `current_length` to reflect the addition of another valid number in the streak.

8. **Updating Maximum Length**:
   ```python
   if current_length >= 2:
       max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
   ```
   - After exiting the while loop, if `current_length` is at least 2, we update `max_length` to ensure it holds the longest streak found.

9. **Final Check and Return**:
   ```python
   if max_length >= 2:
       return max_length
   else:
       return -1
   ```
   - Finally, we check if `max_length` is at least 2 (indicating a valid streak was found). If yes, return it; otherwise, return -1 to indicate no valid streak exists.

### Working Example

Letâ€™s use the following example to illustrate the code in action:

**Input:** `nums = [2, 4, 16, 256, 1]`

1. **Sorting**: 
   - The sorted array becomes `[1, 2, 4, 16, 256]`.

2. **Creating Set**: 
   - The set is `{1, 2, 4, 16, 256}`.

3. **Iterating**:
   - For `num = 1`: 
     - No square streak (1 doesn't have a square in the set).
   - For `num = 2`: 
     - `2^2 = 4` (exists in the set).
     - `4^2 = 16` (exists in the set).
     - `16^2 = 256` (exists in the set).
     - The current streak length is 4: `[2, 4, 16, 256]`.
   - For `num = 4`: 
     - `4^2 = 16` (exists in the set).
     - `16^2 = 256` (exists in the set).
     - The current streak length is 3: `[4, 16, 256]`.
   - For `num = 16`: 
     - `16^2 = 256` (exists in the set).
     - The current streak length is 2: `[16, 256]`.
   - For `num = 256`: 
     - `256^2` is not in the set, so no streak.
   
4. **Updating Maximum Length**:
   - After checking all numbers, `max_length` is updated to 4 (from the streak starting with `2`).

5. **Returning the Result**:
   - Since `max_length` is 4, the function returns `4`.
