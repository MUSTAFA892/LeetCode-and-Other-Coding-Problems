1. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `maxChunksToSorted` accepts a list `arr` of integers and returns the maximum number of chunks that can be made to sort the array.
   - `arr` is a permutation of the integers from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Variables:**
   - `n = len(arr)`: This gets the length of the array.
   - `max_ = 0`: This variable will store the largest value encountered so far in the current chunk as we traverse the array.
   - `chunks = 0`: This is the counter that tracks how many chunks can be created.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over every element of the array, checking if the current chunk can be closed (i.e., whether it can be sorted independently).

4. **Tracking Maximum Element:**
   - `max_ = max(max_, arr[i])`: For each index `i`, we update `max_` to be the larger of the current `max_` or the current element `arr[i]`.
   - This ensures that `max_` represents the largest number encountered in the chunk so far.

5. **Chunk Formation Condition:**
   - `if max_ == i`: This condition checks if the current maximum value (`max_`) is equal to the current index (`i`).
   - If this is true, it means that the elements from index `0` to `i` can be sorted independently, as no larger value after index `i` will disrupt their order.

6. **Incrementing Chunk Count:**
   - When the condition `max_ == i` is satisfied, we know that we have completed a valid chunk. Therefore, we increment the `chunks` counter by 1.

7. **Returning Result:**
   - The function returns the total number of chunks (`chunks`), which is the final answer.

8. **Time Complexity:**
   - **O(n)**: The algorithm only traverses the array once (linear time complexity).

9. **Space Complexity:**
   - **O(1)**: The algorithm uses only a few extra variables (`max_`, `chunks`), so the space complexity is constant.

10. **Edge Cases:**
   - The algorithm works for arrays of various lengths, including edge cases like an array with just one element (which is already sorted).

### **Working Example:**

Let’s go through an example with the following input:

```python
arr = [1, 0, 2, 3, 4]
```

**Sorted version of `arr`**: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`

#### Step-by-Step Execution:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `n = 5`
   - `max_ = 0`
   - `chunks = 0`

2. **First iteration (i = 0):**
   - `arr[0] = 1`
   - `max_ = max(0, 1) = 1`
   - `max_ != 0` → No chunk yet.

3. **Second iteration (i = 1):**
   - `arr[1] = 0`
   - `max_ = max(1, 0) = 1`
   - `max_ == i (1 == 1)` → A chunk can be made.
   - `chunks = 1`

4. **Third iteration (i = 2):**
   - `arr[2] = 2`
   - `max_ = max(1, 2) = 2`
   - `max_ != i (2 != 2)` → No chunk yet.

5. **Fourth iteration (i = 3):**
   - `arr[3] = 3`
   - `max_ = max(2, 3) = 3`
   - `max_ == i (3 == 3)` → A chunk can be made.
   - `chunks = 2`

6. **Fifth iteration (i = 4):**
   - `arr[4] = 4`
   - `max_ = max(3, 4) = 4`
   - `max_ == i (4 == 4)` → A chunk can be made.
   - `chunks = 3`

7. **Final Result:**
   - `chunks = 4`
   
Thus, the function will return `4`, which is the maximum number of chunks that can be made from this array such that when each chunk is sorted, the whole array becomes sorted.
