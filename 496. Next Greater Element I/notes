1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `nextGreaterElement` accepts two arguments: `nums1` (a list of integers) and `nums2` (another list of integers). The goal is to find the **next greater element** for each element in `nums1` that appears in `nums2`.

2. **Result Initialization**:
   - `result = []`: Initializes an empty list `result` where the next greater elements for `nums1` will be stored.

3. **Looping Over `nums1`**:
   - `for num in nums1`: The function loops through each element in `nums1` to determine the next greater element in `nums2`.

4. **Finding Index in `nums2`**:
   - `value = nums2.index(num)`: For each element `num` from `nums1`, we find its index in `nums2` using `index()`. This is because we need to check the elements **after** it in `nums2` to find the next greater element.

5. **Flag to Track Greater Element**:
   - `found_greater = False`: This flag is used to check if a greater element was found for the current `num`. If no greater element is found, `-1` will be appended to `result`.

6. **Looping Over Elements After `num` in `nums2`**:
   - `for j in range(value + 1, len(nums2))`: This inner loop starts from the index `value + 1` (i.e., the element after the current `num` in `nums2`) and iterates through the rest of `nums2`.

7. **Checking for Greater Element**:
   - `if nums2[j] > num`: If the current element `nums2[j]` is greater than `num`, then `nums2[j]` is the next greater element for `num`, and it is appended to `result`.

8. **Breaking the Inner Loop**:
   - `found_greater = True`: Once we find the next greater element, we set the flag `found_greater` to `True` and break out of the loop, as we don't need to look further.

9. **Appending `-1` if No Greater Element is Found**:
   - `if not found_greater`: If the inner loop finishes without finding a greater element (i.e., `found_greater` remains `False`), `-1` is appended to `result`.

10. **Returning the Final Result**:
    - `return result`: After all iterations, the `result` list is returned, which contains the next greater elements for all elements in `nums1` based on `nums2`.

### Working Example:

Let's walk through an example with the input:

```python
nums1 = [4, 1, 2]
nums2 = [1, 3, 4, 2]
```

1. **First iteration (`num = 4`)**:
   - `value = nums2.index(4)` → `value = 2` (index of `4` in `nums2`).
   - Loop starts from `j = 3` (element after `4` in `nums2`).
   - `nums2[3] = 2`, which is **not greater** than `4`.
   - No greater element found, so `-1` is appended to `result`.
   
   **`result = [-1]`**

2. **Second iteration (`num = 1`)**:
   - `value = nums2.index(1)` → `value = 0` (index of `1` in `nums2`).
   - Loop starts from `j = 1`.
   - `nums2[1] = 3`, which **is greater** than `1`.
   - `3` is appended to `result`.
   
   **`result = [-1, 3]`**

3. **Third iteration (`num = 2`)**:
   - `value = nums2.index(2)` → `value = 3` (index of `2` in `nums2`).
   - Loop starts from `j = 4`, but `j` is out of bounds.
   - No greater element found, so `-1` is appended to `result`.
   
   **`result = [-1, 3, -1]`**

### Final Output:

```python
[-1, 3, -1]
```
