# ✅ **Problem Meaning (Simple Explanation)**

We want to make **every element** in `nums` divisible by **3**.

From earlier logic:

* If a number **is divisible by 3** → needs **0** operations
* If a number **is NOT divisible by 3** → needs **1** operation
  (either +1 or –1)

So the total minimum operations =
👉 **count of numbers that are NOT divisible by 3**

Your solution implements exactly this logic.

# 🧠 **Code Explanation (Line-by-Line)**

```python
alr_zero = 0
```

* This counts how many numbers are **already divisible by 3**.

---

```python
for i in nums:
    if i % 3 == 0:
        alr_zero += 1
```

* Loop through each number.
* If `i % 3 == 0`, this means the number is divisible by 3.
* Increase `alr_zero` because this number needs **zero** operations.

---

```python
return len(nums) - alr_zero
```

* Total numbers → `len(nums)`
* Subtract the count of numbers already divisible by 3
* This gives the numbers that need **1** operation each.

So the final answer =
✔ number of elements NOT divisible by 3.

# 🔍 **Working Example**

### Input:

```
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

Let’s check each:

| Number | Divisible by 3? | Needs Op? |
| ------ | --------------- | --------- |
| 1      | No              | Yes       |
| 2      | No              | Yes       |
| 3      | Yes             | No        |
| 4      | No              | Yes       |

From these:

* Already divisible: only `3` → count = 1
* Total numbers: 4
* So operations needed = `4 - 1 = 3`

# 🎉 **Final Answer: 3 operations**
