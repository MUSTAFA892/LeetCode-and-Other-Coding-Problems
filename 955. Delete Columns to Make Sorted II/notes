# 📝 Problem Reminder (955 – in simple words)

You are given several strings of equal length.

You may **delete entire columns** (same index in all strings).

After deletions, the **rows (strings)** must be in **lexicographical (dictionary) order**:

```
strs[0] ≤ strs[1] ≤ strs[2] ≤ ...
```

Your goal:
👉 **Delete the minimum number of columns** to make this true.

# 🧠 High-Level Idea of the Code

This solution works **column by column (left → right)** and tracks:

* Which **adjacent row pairs** already have their order decided
* Deletes a column **only if it breaks an undecided pair**
* Stops early once **all row pairs are decided**

---

# 🧩 Key Data Structures Used

### `pairs` array

```python
pairs = [0] * (len(strs) - 1)
```

Meaning:

* `pairs[k] = 0` → order between `strs[k]` and `strs[k+1]` is **not decided yet**
* `pairs[k] = 1` → order is **already decided** and never needs checking again

This is the **core concept** that makes 955 different from 944.

---

# 🧱 Code Explanation (Step by Step)

---

## 1️⃣ Initialization

```python
count = 0
pairs = [0] * (len(strs) - 1)
```

* `count` → number of deleted columns
* `pairs` → tracks ordering state of each adjacent row pair

If there are `n` strings, there are `n-1` adjacent comparisons.

---

## 2️⃣ Loop through columns (left → right)

```python
for i in range(len(strs[0])):
```

Each column is checked **only once**, from left to right, because lexicographic order works left → right.

---

## 3️⃣ Temporary decision buffer

```python
temp = pairs[:]
delete_col = False
```

Why this is necessary:

* Decisions made in a column should apply **only if the column is kept**
* If the column is deleted, **all decisions in it must be discarded**

So:

* `temp` stores *potential* decisions
* `pairs` stores *confirmed* decisions

---

## 4️⃣ Compare adjacent rows for this column

```python
for j in range(1, len(strs)):
```

This compares:

```
strs[j-1] vs strs[j]
```

But **only if that pair is still undecided**.

---

## 5️⃣ Handle undecided pairs

```python
if pairs[j-1] == 0:
```

Only undecided pairs matter.
Decided pairs are ignored forever.

---

### Case A: Order is decided (`<`)

```python
if ord(strs[j-1][i]) < ord(strs[j][i]):
    temp[j-1] = 1
```

Meaning:

* This column proves `strs[j-1] < strs[j]`
* This pair is now **permanently decided**
* Later columns will never be checked for this pair

---

### Case B: Order breaks (`>`)

```python
elif ord(strs[j-1][i]) > ord(strs[j][i]):
    count += 1
    delete_col = True
    break
```

Meaning:

* This column breaks lexicographic order
* Column **must be deleted**
* All decisions in this column are ignored

---

### Case C: Equal (`=`)

Nothing happens:

* Order still undecided
* Need future columns

---

## 6️⃣ Commit decisions only if column survives

```python
if not delete_col:
    pairs = temp
```

* If column was deleted → ignore everything
* If column was kept → apply decisions from this column

---

## 7️⃣ Early stop condition

```python
if all(pairs):
    break
```

If **all adjacent pairs are decided**:

* The rows are already fully ordered
* Remaining columns **cannot affect the order**
* Stop immediately

This is essential for cases like `["xc","yb","za"]`.

---

## 8️⃣ Return result

```python
return count
```

# 🧪 Full Working Example (Very Important)

### Input

```python
strs = ["xga", "xfb", "yfa"]
```

Grid:

```
x g a
x f b
y f a
```

Initial:

```
pairs = [0, 0]
count = 0
```

---

## 🔹 Column 0

Characters:

```
x
x
y
```

Comparisons:

* Pair 0: `x == x` → undecided
* Pair 1: `x < y` → decided

Result:

```
temp = [0, 1]
pairs = [0, 1]
```

Column kept.

---

## 🔹 Column 1

Characters:

```
g
f
f
```

Check only undecided pairs:

* Pair 0: `g > f` → order breaks

Action:

```
count = 1
column deleted
pairs unchanged = [0, 1]
```

---

## 🔹 Column 2

Characters:

```
a
b
a
```

Check undecided pairs:

* Pair 0: `a < b` → decided
* Pair 1: already decided → ignored

Result:

```
pairs = [1, 1]
```

All pairs decided → stop.

---

## ✅ Final Answer

```
count = 1
```

Remaining strings after deletion:

```
"xa"
"xb"
"ya"
```

Which is:

```
xa ≤ xb ≤ ya
```

✔ Correct
