1. **Sorting the Input List**:
   - The input list `nums` is first sorted using `nums.sort()`. Sorting helps group duplicates together, which is useful for handling duplicate permutations more efficiently. Sorting ensures that identical elements are adjacent to each other, which allows us to skip them when generating permutations.

2. **Using `itertools.permutations()`**:
   - The method uses the `itertools.permutations()` function to generate all possible permutations of the sorted list `nums`. This function returns an iterator of all possible ordered arrangements (tuples) of the elements in `nums`.

3. **Checking for Duplicates**:
   - To ensure that only unique permutations are included, the method checks if each permutation (`i`) is already in the `result` list. If the permutation is not already in `result`, it gets appended. This helps in avoiding duplicates, but it is not the most efficient way to handle duplicates.

4. **Result List**:
   - The `result` list is initialized as an empty list. As the permutations are generated, only the unique ones (those not already in `result`) are added to this list.

5. **Time Complexity**:
   - The time complexity of this solution is **O(n! * n)**. The `itertools.permutations()` function generates all `n!` permutations, and for each permutation, the method checks if it's already in the `result` list. The check `if i not in result` takes **O(n)** time in the worst case because it scans the entire list of results.

6. **Space Complexity**:
   - The space complexity is **O(n! * n)** due to the storage of all unique permutations in `result`. Each permutation is a list of length `n`, and there can be up to `n!` permutations in total.

7. **Use of Tuples**:
   - The permutations generated by `itertools.permutations()` are tuples, but the method appends these directly to `result`. Since `result` stores them as tuples, no further conversion is needed.

8. **Inefficiency in Duplicate Handling**:
   - The use of `if i not in result` makes the solution inefficient for large lists with duplicates. This check traverses the `result` list for each new permutation, leading to unnecessary overhead. A more efficient way would be to use a set or a more sophisticated backtracking approach to generate unique permutations in the first place.

9. **Handling Duplicates Manually**:
   - The solution works by manually filtering out duplicate permutations after they are generated. This works, but it’s not optimal, especially if the input list has many duplicates.

10. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the input list `nums` is empty (`[]`), the method will return an empty list (`[]`).
   - If the input list has only one unique number repeated multiple times (e.g., `[1, 1, 1]`), the method will correctly return just one unique permutation.

### Walking Through an Example:

Let’s walk through the code using an example:  
**Input**: `nums = [1, 1, 2]`

#### Step-by-step Execution:

1. **Sorting**:
   - The input list `nums` is sorted first:
     ```python
     nums.sort()  # nums = [1, 1, 2]
     ```

2. **Generate Permutations**:
   - The method generates all possible permutations of `nums = [1, 1, 2]` using `itertools.permutations()`. This will give us the following permutations:
     ```python
     permutations = [(1, 1, 2), (1, 2, 1), (1, 1, 2), (2, 1, 1), (2, 1, 1), (1, 2, 1)]
     ```

3. **Check for Duplicates**:
   - We then iterate over each permutation, checking whether it already exists in `result`:
   
     - **First permutation** `(1, 1, 2)`:
       - Since `result` is empty, we add `(1, 1, 2)` to `result`:  
         `result = [(1, 1, 2)]`

     - **Second permutation** `(1, 2, 1)`:
       - `(1, 2, 1)` is not in `result`, so we add it:  
         `result = [(1, 1, 2), (1, 2, 1)]`

     - **Third permutation** `(1, 1, 2)`:
       - `(1, 1, 2)` is already in `result`, so we skip it.

     - **Fourth permutation** `(2, 1, 1)`:
       - `(2, 1, 1)` is not in `result`, so we add it:  
         `result = [(1, 1, 2), (1, 2, 1), (2, 1, 1)]`

     - **Fifth permutation** `(2, 1, 1)`:
       - `(2, 1, 1)` is already in `result`, so we skip it.

     - **Sixth permutation** `(1, 2, 1)`:
       - `(1, 2, 1)` is already in `result`, so we skip it.

4. **Final Result**:
   - After processing all permutations, the final `result` contains the unique permutations:
     ```python
     result = [(1, 1, 2), (1, 2, 1), (2, 1, 1)]
     ```

#### Output:

```python
[(1, 1, 2), (1, 2, 1), (2, 1, 1)]
```
