### 1. **Problem Understanding:**
   The problem asks us to find how many valid 4-tuples `(i, j, k, l)` can be formed from the input list of integers `nums` such that the products of two different pairs `(nums[i] * nums[j])` and `(nums[k] * nums[l])` are equal, where `i < j` and `k < l`.

### 2. **Product Generation (Nested Loops):**
   - We use two nested loops to generate all possible products of pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])` from the list.
   - The first loop iterates over each element, and the second loop iterates over the elements after the first element (to avoid duplication of pairs).
   - The product of each pair `(nums[i] * nums[j])` is appended to the list `ans`.

### 3. **Counting Product Frequencies:**
   - After generating all possible products, we use `Counter` from the `collections` module to count how often each product occurs.
   - `dict_1` stores the frequency of each product in the form of a dictionary-like object.

### 4. **Counting Valid Pairs:**
   - For each product that occurs multiple times (`count > 1`), we calculate how many pairs of pairs can be formed.
   - This is done using the formula `count * (count - 1) // 2`, which is a combinatorics calculation to select two pairs from `count` occurrences.
   - Each valid combination of pairs will correspond to two valid 4-tuples, but we will adjust for this in the next step.

### 5. **Multiplying by 8:**
   - Each valid pair of pairs can form 8 distinct valid 4-tuples (because we can rearrange the pairs in 8 ways).
   - Therefore, we multiply the final count by 8 to account for all possible permutations of the pairs.

### 6. **Returning the Result:**
   - The result is returned as `sum_ * 8`, which gives the total number of valid 4-tuples satisfying the condition.

### 7. **Time Complexity:**
   - Generating all pairs takes `O(n^2)` time, where `n` is the length of the list `nums`.
   - Counting the frequency of products takes `O(n^2)` because we are counting the pairs' products.
   - The overall time complexity of the algorithm is `O(n^2)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the list.

### 8. **Space Complexity:**
   - The space complexity is also `O(n^2)` because we store all pair products in the list `ans`, and the frequency counter `dict_1` stores each unique product along with its frequency.

### 9. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - If the list `nums` has fewer than 2 elements, there are no valid pairs, so the function will return 0.

### 10. **Efficiency:**
   - The solution is efficient for moderately sized input arrays (up to a few thousand elements), but it might struggle with extremely large arrays due to its quadratic time complexity.

### **Working Example:**

Let's take an example to understand the working of the code:

#### Input:
```python
nums = [2, 3, 4, 6]
```

#### Step-by-Step Execution:

1. **Generate All Pair Products:**
   - The pairs and their products are:
     - `(2, 3)` → `6`
     - `(2, 4)` → `8`
     - `(2, 6)` → `12`
     - `(3, 4)` → `12`
     - `(3, 6)` → `18`
     - `(4, 6)` → `24`
   - The `ans` list after this step is: `[6, 8, 12, 12, 18, 24]`.

2. **Count the Frequency of Each Product:**
   - The `Counter` object `dict_1` will be:
     ```python
     dict_1 = {6: 1, 8: 1, 12: 2, 18: 1, 24: 1}
     ```

3. **Calculate Valid Pairs:**
   - For each product, calculate the number of ways to pick two pairs:
     - Product `6` appears once → no valid pairs.
     - Product `8` appears once → no valid pairs.
     - Product `12` appears twice → `2 * (2 - 1) / 2 = 1` valid pair.
     - Product `18` appears once → no valid pairs.
     - Product `24` appears once → no valid pairs.
   - The `sum_` variable after this step will be `1`.

4. **Multiply by 8 to Count All Valid Tuples:**
   - The result is `1 * 8 = 8`.

#### Output:
```python
8
```
