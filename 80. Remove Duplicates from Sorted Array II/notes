1. This question is kind of very similar to the last remove element question where  they ask to remove all the duplicate value of the number.. but in this question  u have to keep one duplicate value of the number and then return  the length of the array at the last..

2. First we have checked whether the length of the array is lesser than or equal to 2 or not because if it is lesser than 2 than its length would 1 and it wont have any duplicate value and if length os equal to 2 than it might have two different number or one number and its duplicate and it is an exception in this question..

3. Then take the extra variable k which would keep the track for the length of the array ..

4. Then run the loop over the array from 2 to its length then check the condition if the value at i is not equal to value at  k-2 

5. If the condition is true then replace the value at k with the value at i and then increment 1 in k...

6. Then return k to display its length...
