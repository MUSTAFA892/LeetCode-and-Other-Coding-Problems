# Code Explanation

```python
class Solution:
    def discountPrices(self, sentence: str, discount: int) -> str:
        sentence = sentence.split()
```

### ✔ Split Sentence

* Converts the sentence into a **list of words**
* Words are separated by a single space
* Example:

  ```
  "I paid $100 today"
  → ["I","paid","$100","today"]
  ```

---

```python
        for i in range(len(sentence)):
            value = sentence[i]
```

### ✔ Loop through every word

* `value` = current word
* `i` keeps the index (so we can update it later)

---

```python
            try:
                int(value[1:])
                price = int(value[1:])
```

### ✔ Try converting characters after `$` to an integer

This checks if the word **looks like a valid price**:

* `$100` → `100` → valid
* `$30` → `30` → valid
* `$` → `""` → ❌ error → caught
* `$5e` → `"5e"` → ❌ error → caught
* `abc` → `"bc"` → ❌ error → caught

If conversion fails → `ValueError` → we skip this word.

If successful → assign numeric value to `price`.

---

```python
                if value[0] == '$':
```

### ✔ Ensure it actually starts with `$`

Even if conversion works, we still confirm the first character is `$`.

---

```python
                    final = price * (100 - discount) / 100
```

### ✔ Apply Discount Formula

```
Final Price = price × (100 − discount) / 100
```

Example
price = 100
discount = 20%

```
final = 100 × 80 / 100 = 80
```

---

```python
                    value_updation = str('$'+str(final))
```

### ✔ Convert result back to a string and attach `$`

Example:

```
80.0  → "$80.0"
```

---

```python
                    if '.' in value_updation:
                        decimal_part = value_updation.split('.')[-1]
                        if len(decimal_part) == 1:
                            value_updation += '0'
```

### ✔ Handle decimal formatting

If value contains a decimal point:

* Check decimal digits count
* If only **1 digit**, add one zero

Examples:

```
$80.0  → $80.00
$41.2 → $41.20
```

---

```python
                    else:
                        value_updation += '.00'
```

### ✔ If no decimal part

Add `.00`

Example:

```
$27 → $27.00
```

---

```python
                    sentence[i] = value_updation
```

### ✔ Replace the original word with updated price

---

```python
            except ValueError:
    
                continue
```

### ✔ If price is invalid

Skip it — leave word unchanged.

---

```python
        return " ".join(sentence)
```

### ✔ Re-join words into a sentence string and return it

---

# 🧪 Working Test Case (Note)

### **Input**

```
sentence = "I bought a $100 phone and a $5e pen and a $30 case"
discount = 20
```

---

## Execution Flow

Sentence becomes:

```
["I","bought","a","$100","phone","and","a","$5e","pen","and","a","$30","case"]
```

---

### 🔹 Word: `"I"`

* Not a price
* Skipped

---

### 🔹 Word: `"bought"`

* Not a price
* Skipped

---

### 🔹 Word: `"a"`

* Not a price
* Skipped

---

### 🔹 Word: `"$100"`

* `value[1:] = "100"`
* `int("100")` → valid
* starts with `$` → valid price
* price = 100
* discount = 20%

```
final = 100 × 80 / 100 = 80.0
```

Format:

```
"$80.0" → "$80.00"
```

Word becomes:

```
"$80.00"
```

---

### 🔹 Word: `"phone"`

Not a price

---

### 🔹 Word: `"and"`

Not a price

---

### 🔹 Word: `"a"`

Not a price

---

### 🔹 Word: `"$5e"`

* `value[1:] = "5e"`
* `int("5e")` → ERROR
* Goes to except block
* Word remains unchanged

---

### 🔹 Word: `"pen"`

Not a price

---

### 🔹 Word: `"and"`

Not a price

---

### 🔹 Word: `"a"`

Not a price

---

### 🔹 Word: `"$30"`

* `value[1:] = "30"`
* valid integer
* valid price
* price = 30

Apply discount:

```
30 × 80 / 100 = 24.0
```

Format:

```
"$24.0" → "$24.00"
```

Word becomes:

```
"$24.00"
```

---

### 🔹 Word: `"case"`

Not a price

---

# 🎯 Final Output

```
"I bought a $80.00 phone and a $5e pen and a $24.00 case"
```
